description: This rule governs a major refactor and migration of a legacy codebase. It focuses on decoupling integrations (especially Telegram), introducing an internal API, and reorganizing all logic into a new src/ structure. Agents should consult the full rule for workflows involving rewrites, file moves, or structural planning with .md files.

### üß† Updated Cursor Rules (More Generalized)

Here‚Äôs a version that works for both large and small changes:

```markdown
## Cursor Refactor Assistant ‚Äî Project Rules

This codebase is undergoing a major overhaul. All AI-assisted edits must follow these principles:

### üîç General Goals
- Reduce tight coupling (especially with Telegram)
- Extract core logic into `src/core`, and integrations into `src/integrations`
- Reorganize legacy folders into a clean `src/` directory structure
- Add internal APIs to expose reusable functionality
- Improve naming, modularity, and error handling

### üß≠ Workflow Rules
- Each file or folder targeted for change should have a `.plan.md` file in `/plans/`
- The `.plan.md` should explain the current role, issues, and future migration plan
- Cursor should **refer to the `.plan.md`** before suggesting code changes
- Cursor can suggest **file splits, merges, renames**, or **folder moves** as part of plans
- After refactor, a `.after.md` file should summarize the new state

### üìå Code Practices
- Use `src/` as the root for all new code
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep business logic out of integrations
- Always export named functions unless a default export is justified
- Include JSDoc or inline comments for exported functions

### üß™ Testing Rules (During Integration)

- **Every new or refactored module must include a corresponding test file in `/tests/`**
  - Mirror the folder structure (e.g., `src/core/points/ ‚Üí tests/core/points/`)
  - Name test files with `.test.js` suffix

- **Use Jest as the testing framework**
  - Globals like `describe`, `test`, `expect`, and `jest.mock()` are available
  - Do not `import` or `require` Jest directly

- **Test coverage must include:**
  - Core service methods (public API)
  - Edge cases and invalid inputs
  - All new business logic paths

- **If a file is adapted (e.g., `gatekeep.js` now uses `UserService`):**
  - Create or update a test that verifies this integration
  - Ensure legacy behavior is preserved during Phase 1

- **Mock all database and external service calls**
  - Use `jest.mock()` to simulate repository behavior
  - Do not perform real data operations in unit tests

- **Update `status.md` after test coverage is added for a module**
  - Include a short description of what's covered in `tests/README.md`
