# Tokenomics

> **TL;DR**
> MS2 is NOEMA's native utility and governance token. Holders get preferential funding rates for Generation Credits and access to exclusive tools. Create Referral Vaults, publish Spells, and contribute models to earn up to **24%** of the platform fees your network generates.

## Origin

MS2 launched on Solana's Pump.Fun on April 9th, 2024, as a community celebration around NOEMA's early development. What began as a meme-coin airdrop — with over 10% distributed to MiladyStation NFT holders and early supporters — grew into something more substantive.

In January 2025, the core developer bridged the treasury and personal holdings of MS2 to Ethereum, choosing long-term composability, a broader builder ecosystem, and stronger security guarantees.

## From Speculation to Utility

In NOEMA's early days, holding MS2 granted free access to the platform. Today the platform runs on a credit system designed to be sustainable:

- **Generation Credits (GCs)** — pay-as-you-go credits for running AI workflows
- **Funding Rate** — deposits incur a 5% fee that funds infrastructure and development

Holders who fund using **MS2** (or **$CULT**) have two advantages:

1. **Fee rebate.** Deposit through a Referral Vault and the 5% fee is streamed back to you.
2. **Governance and early access.** MS2 holders influence roadmap priorities and receive early access to experimental tools.

## The Incentive Stack

| Layer | Who Earns | How | Reward |
|-------|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Referral Vault** | Anyone | Create a vault, share your link. Deposits routed through it credit you. | **5%** of every deposit |
| **Spell Creator** | Workflow authors | Publish a Spell. Each time someone runs it → | **+5%** of execution cost |
| **Model Trainer** | Dataset and model contributors | Provide fine-tuned checkpoints others can call | **Up to 10%** (configurable) |
| **Stacked Earnings** | Power users | Combine all three layers | **Up to 24%** of fees |

**Example:** Alice funds 1,000 GCs through Bob's referral link, then runs a Spell built by Carol that uses Carol's trained model.

- Bob (referral) — 50 GCs
- Carol (Spell + model) — 100 GCs (5% + 5%)
- Protocol — 850 GCs for compute, storage, and treasury

## Supply and Treasury

The founder currently holds a significant portion of MS2's circulating supply with the explicit intent of re-acquiring as much of the float as possible — effectively reclaiming equity in the protocol.

- Tokens sent to the NOEMA Treasury are reserved for protocol incentives and liquidity
- Scheduled emissions support vault rebates and future grants
- No venture allocation; no vesting cliffs

## Multi-Asset Support and $CULT Alignment

NOEMA maintains a strategic partnership with **$CULT** (the Remilia ecosystem token). Deposits in CULT receive the same 5% vault rebate as MS2.

Beyond MS2 and CULT, NOEMA accepts ETH, stablecoins (USDC/DAI), and select partner tokens. All incoming deposits are:

1. Converted to Generation Credits at live oracle exchange rates
2. Subject to the funding rate fee, rebated when routed through a Referral Vault
3. Partially retained in treasury to fund compute, liquidity, and development

---

## The Flywheel

1. MS2 holders top up credits → protocol revenue
2. Creators publish Spells and models → richer library
3. Users generate media → shareable content spreads
4. Shares contain referral links → more deposits flow in
5. Treasury grows → funds new features → attracts more users

## Risks

MS2 is a utility token integral to NOEMA's operation, not a promise of profit. Crypto markets are volatile, smart contracts carry risk, and the regulatory environment continues to evolve. Do your own research and never risk funds you cannot afford to lose.

*Why 24%?* The theoretical maximum combines a 5% referral rebate plus a 20% creator rebate on the remaining 95% of credits (0.05 + 0.20 × 0.95 = 0.24), yielding 24% of the original deposit.
