# Tokenomics – The MS2 Flywheel

> **TL;DR**  
> • **MS2 is NOEMA’s native utility & governance token.**  
> • Holders get the best funding rates for Generation Credits and access to exclusive tools.  
> • Create Referral Vaults, Spells and Models to earn up to **24 %*** of the platform fees your network generates.

## 1. A (Not-So-Typical) Origin Story

MS2 began life on **Solana’s Pump.Fun** on April 9th, 2024 as a playful celebration of StationThisBot’s resurrection (the bot crashed on the founder’s wife’s computer; a new machine – and a mountain of code – followed). What started as a meme-coin airdrop (>10 % went to MiladyStation NFT holders and friends) quickly escaped the trenches:

* Early speculators like **Mr Frog** and **Bob Lax** provided depth and stability for our loyal supportors to profit from.  
* **Frank DeGods** shouted us out during the December-2024 AI boom, pushing MS2 to an **8 M USD market cap**.

But Solana’s lightning-fast CENTRALIZED shit chain comes with trade-offs. In January-2025 the core developer bridged the treasury and personal holdings of MS2 **to Ethereum**, choosing long-term composability, security and a broader builder ecosystem.

## 2. From Speculation to Sustainable Utility

In the old days, simply **holding** MS2 let you use the bot for free – fun, but not a viable business. Today NOEMA runs on a credit system:

* **Generation Credits (GCs)** – pay-as-you-go points for running AI workflows.  
* **Funding Rate** – preferred deposits incur a **5 % fee** that fuels infrastructure and R&D.

Holders who top-up using **MS2 (or $CULT)** have two big advantages:

1. **Fee Rebate.** Deposit via a **Referral Vault** (see below) and the 5 % fee is streamed back to you.  
2. **Governance & Perks.** MS2 holders influence roadmap priorities and gain early access to experimental tools.

In short: *trade your MS2 for credits, keep the fee, shape the future.*

## 3. The NOEMA Incentive Stack

| Layer | Who Earns? | How It Works | Reward |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Referral Vault** | Anyone | Create a personal vault smart-contract, share your link. All deposits routed via your vault | **5 %** of every deposit |
| **Spell Creator** | Workflow authors | Publish a Spell (a curated multi-tool workflow). Each time someone runs it → | **+5 %** of Spell execution cost |
| **Model Trainer** | Data / model contributors | Provide fine-tuned checkpoints the community can call | **Up to 10 %** (configurable) |
| **Stacked Earnings** | Power user | Combine all three layers | **Up to 24 %*** of fees |

Example: Alice funds 1 000 GCs through Bob’s referral link and runs “✨ Anime Upscaler” (a Spell using Carol’s model). Distribution:

* **Bob (Referral)** – 50 GCs  
* **Carol (Spell + Model)** – 100 GCs (5 % + 5 %)  
* **Protocol** – 850 GCs for compute, storage & treasury

## 4. Supply, Treasury & Founder Intent

The founder currently controls the majority of MS2 circulating supply **with the explicit goal of re-acquiring** as much of the float as possible. Think of it as reclaiming company equity:

* Tokens sent to the **NOEMA Treasury** are locked for protocol incentives and liquidity.  
* Small scheduled emissions support vault rebates and future grants.  
* No venture allocation, no vesting cliffs – growth is community driven.

## 5. Multi-Asset Support & Alignment with $CULT

We maintain a strategic partnership with **$CULT** (the Remilia ecosystem coin). Deposits in CULT enjoy the same 5 % vault rebate, fostering cross-community collaboration and liquidity diversity.

Don't Worry About It.

Beyond MS2 and CULT, NOEMA accepts a curated basket of additional assets – **ETH, stablecoins (USDC/DAI), and select partner-project tokens**. All incoming deposits are:

1. **Converted to Generation Credits** at live oracle exchange rates.  
2. **Subject to a funding rate % fee**, rebated when routed through a Referral Vault.  
3. **Partially retained in treasury** to diversify the war-chest used for compute, liquidity and R&D.

This multi-asset strategy lets contributors pay in whatever token they already hold while steadily growing NOEMA’s on-chain reserves.

## 6. The Flywheel

1. MS2 holders top-up credits → protocol revenue.  
2. Creators publish Spells & Models → richer library.  
3. Users generate stunning media → shareable content spreads.  
4. Shares contain referral links → more deposits cycle in.  
5. Treasury grows → funds new features → attracts more users.

Rinse, repeat, iterate.

---

*Why 24 %?* The theoretical maximum return combines a 5 % referral rebate (0.05 D) plus a 20 % creator rebate on the remaining 95 % of credits (0.20 × 0.95 D = 0.19 D). Together this yields 0.24 D, or **24 %** of the original deposit.

## 7. Risks & Forward-Looking Statements

MS2 is **not** a promise of profit; it is a utility token integral to NOEMA’s operation. Crypto markets are volatile, smart contracts carry risk, and regulations evolve. Always DYOR and never risk funds you cannot afford to lose.
