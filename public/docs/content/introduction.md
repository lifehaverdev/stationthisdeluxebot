## 🚧 Where We’re Heading (And How *You* Can Help)

NOEMA is already powerful, but we have **big dreams**:

• **End-to-End Encryption & Zero-Knowledge Storage** – Help us deliver private, trust-less data storage.  
• **UI/UX Polish** – The Web Canvas is functional, yet we long for a richer, more intuitive interface.  
• **Performance & Scalability** – Contribute optimisations to handle ever-growing workloads.  
• **More Tools & Workflows** – Got an idea for a killer AI workflow? Add a new `ToolDefinition` and surprise the community.

If any of these challenges excite you, **we’d love your contribution**. Head over to our GitHub, read `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`, then open a discussion, issue or pull request. Every line of code, doc fix and design mock-up helps steer **NOEMA** towards its fullest potential.
