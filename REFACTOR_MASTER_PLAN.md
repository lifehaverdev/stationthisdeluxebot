# Refactoring Master Plan

## 1. Summary of Key Components

### Core Domain Components
- **User & Account System** - User identity, preferences, verification, and account management
- **Session Management** - Platform-agnostic user session tracking with Telegram adapter
- **Points Economy** - Complex economy with multiple point types (points, doints, boints, qoints, exp)
- **Generation System** - Image generation request handling, settings, and result management
- **Workflow Engine** - Multi-step interactions with state management and platform adapters
- **Command System** - Platform-agnostic command processing with middleware and adapters
- **Queue System** - Task queuing, processing, and delivery with state tracking
- **UI Component System** - Platform-agnostic UI components with platform-specific renderers

### Application Services
- **Session Manager** - High-level session management with platform integration
- **Media Services** - Media processing, watermarking, and delivery
- **Generation Services** - Generation request handling via ComfyDeploy and other providers
- **Analytics Service** - User behavior and system event tracking

### External Integrations
- **Telegram Bot API** - Primary user interface via platform-specific adapters
- **Web Interface** - Alternative access via HTTP/WebSocket
- **MongoDB** - Data persistence with repository abstraction
- **AI/Generation APIs** - Integration with ComfyDeploy and other generation services

## 2. Current Architecture State

### Core Architecture
The codebase has successfully transitioned to a clean architecture approach with the following layers:

1. **Core Domain Layer (`src/core/`)**
   - Contains platform-agnostic business rules and domain models
   - Follows domain-driven design with proper encapsulation
   - Provides repository interfaces for data access abstraction
   - Implements immutable state management patterns

2. **Application Services Layer (`src/services/`)**
   - Implements use cases that orchestrate domain logic
   - Provides higher-level services for application needs
   - Handles cross-cutting concerns like logging and error handling

3. **Adapter Layer (`src/adapters/`, `src/integrations/`)**
   - Bridges between core logic and external platforms/libraries
   - Implements repository interfaces for specific datastores
   - Provides platform-specific adapters (Telegram, Web)

4. **External Interfaces (`src/api/`)**
   - Exposes system functionality through HTTP/REST
   - Provides programmatic access to core functionality

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstracts data access through repository interfaces
   - Provides clean separation between domain logic and data storage
   - Implemented with MongoDB adapters

2. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Isolates platform-specific code from core business logic
   - Provides clean interfaces for platform integration
   - Enables support for multiple platforms (Telegram, Web)

3. **Immutable State Management**
   - Prevents unexpected state mutations with immutable state
   - Enables predictable state transitions and tracking
   - Supports debugging and state history

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Provides loose coupling between components through events
   - Enables extensibility through event subscriptions
   - Supports analytics and monitoring

5. **Workflow System**
   - Implements clean state machine for multi-step interactions
   - Supports branching and conditional flows
   - Provides session persistence for long-running interactions

6. **Command Pattern**
   - Centralizes command handling through command registry
   - Provides middleware pipeline for cross-cutting concerns
   - Supports platform-agnostic command definitions

7. **UI Component System**
   - Defines abstract UI components independent of platform
   - Provides platform-specific renderers
   - Enables consistent UI across platforms

## 6. Architecture Recommendations

### Module Consolidation
1. **Standardize Service Layer Organization**
   - Clarify distinction between application services (`src/services/`) and domain services (`src/core/*/service.js`)
   - Consider reorganizing service layer to improve consistency

2. **Consolidate Adapter Pattern Implementation**
   - Standardize adapter implementation across codebase
   - Address multiple adapter locations: `src/adapters/`, `src/core/*/adapters/`, and `src/integrations/*/adapters/`

3. **Formalize Core/UI as First-Class Citizen**
   - Document UI component system architecture
   - Standardize UI component interfaces and lifecycle
   - Create clear patterns for platform-specific renderers

4. **API Layer Formalization**
   - Formalize API structure and conventions
   - Document API endpoints and response formats
   - Implement consistent authentication and authorization

### Technical Debt Remediation
1. **MongoDB Abstraction Review**
   - Evaluate direct MongoDB dependency in core layer
   - Consider more abstract approach to database access

2. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Ensure consistent error handling across all layers
   - Standardize error reporting and recovery strategies

3. **Asset Management**
   - Relocate assets from `src/mony/` to appropriate location
   - Create proper asset management strategy

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Create architectural documentation for each core module
   - Document cross-component interactions and dependencies
   - Update README files with current implementation details

## 7. Implementation Strategies

### Command Migration Strategy
1. **Workflow-Based Implementation**
   - Use workflow system for all multi-step interactions
   - Define clear step transitions and validation rules
   - Separate UI rendering from business logic

2. **Feature Flag Integration**
   - Implement feature flags for all new implementations
   - Allow gradual rollout and A/B testing
   - Enable fallback to legacy implementations

3. **Platform Adapter Pattern**
   - Create consistent adapter interface for all platforms
   - Implement platform-specific adapters for each command
   - Ensure clean separation between core logic and platform code

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Create unit tests for core business logic
   - Implement integration tests for command flows
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical user journeys

### UI Component Strategy
1. **Component Interfaces**
   - Define clear interfaces for all UI components
   - Implement platform-specific renderers
   - Create component composition patterns

2. **Rendering Separation**
   - Separate business logic from UI rendering
   - Create clean interface between data and presentation
   - Support multiple output formats (Telegram, Web, API)

3. **State Management**
   - Use immutable state for UI components
   - Implement one-way data flow
   - Create clear update patterns

## 8. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Legacy Command Migration**
   - Complex commands with many edge cases
   - Risk of regression during migration
   - Incomplete test coverage

2. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across platforms
   - Handling platform-specific limitations
   - Supporting all platforms equally

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Immutable state overhead for high-frequency updates
   - Repository pattern performance impact
   - Workflow system overhead for simple interactions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Migration**
   - Migrate commands incrementally with feature flags
   - Run old and new implementations in parallel
   - Gradually shift traffic to new implementations

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Create robust test suite for all components
   - Implement integration tests for cross-component interactions
   - Monitor performance metrics during migration

3. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**
   - Document architecture and design decisions
   - Create examples and patterns for developers
   - Establish code reviews and pair programming
