## ‚ú® Key Features

‚Ä¢ One codebase ‚Üí three front-ends (Telegram Bot, Discord Bot, Web Sandbox).  
‚Ä¢ Unified **Internal / External REST API** exposing core capabilities.  
‚Ä¢ Pluggable **ToolDefinition & ToolRegistry** system ‚Äì add new AI workflows with JSON only.  
‚Ä¢ **WorkflowExecutionService** orchestrates sync, webhook & poll execution strategies.  
‚Ä¢ On-chain **CreditService** (Ethereum) with price feeds, NFT valuation & risk engine.  
‚Ä¢ Real-time notifications via WebSockets & platform notifiers.  
‚Ä¢ Modular **Core Services** layer: ComfyUI, Points, Media, Sessions, Storage, OpenAI, Analytics, ‚Ä¶  
‚Ä¢ Resilient startup sequence ‚Äì continues even if optional services are offline.

## üèÜ Unique Selling Points

‚Ä¢ **Crypto-centric AI Service Aggregator** ‚Äì unify cutting-edge AI models with on-chain credit accounts, token-gated access and immutable blockchain audit trails in a single pipeline.

‚Ä¢ **Referral Vault & Incentivised Innovation** ‚Äì earn Credits for inviting new users; build custom workflows, contribute training data or fine-tune models and get rewarded automatically. The result is a powerful community-driven flywheel for new tools, datasets and revenue streams.

‚Ä¢ **NFT Creation Flywheel / Independent AI Lab** ‚Äì one-click minting pipelines transform generated media into ERC-721 collections, letting any user spin-up an independent AI studio that monetises art without leaving the platform.

‚Ä¢ **Uncensored by Default** ‚Äì StationThis does not impose upstream model moderation. We champion creative freedom while respecting legal boundaries in your jurisdiction.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy & Security Disclaimer

StationThis is currently in public beta. While HTTPS, credential encryption and strict access controls are in place, data is **not yet end-to-end encrypted** and some storage components run in shared cloud infrastructure. Private prompts, models or media you upload could theoretically be accessed by platform operators or cloud providers.

Delivering zero-knowledge storage and client-side encryption is our **next top engineering priority**. Until this ships, please avoid storing highly-sensitive or regulated data on StationThis.

| Path                                   | Purpose |
|----------------------------------------|---------|
| `app.js`                               | Application entry ‚Äì initialises DB, Core Services, Platforms & WebSocket server |
| `src/core/`                             | Platform-agnostic services, init logic & dependency injection |
| `src/platforms/`                        | Adapters for Telegram, Discord & Web (Express) |
| `src/api/`                              | Internal & External API routers (mounted by `app.js`) |

## üöÄ Quick Start (Local Dev)

1. **Install deps**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Create `.env`** ‚Äì copy `.env-example` and fill required keys:
   ```env
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=xxxx
   DISCORD_TOKEN=xxxx
   INTERNAL_API_KEY_SYSTEM=super-secret
   ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://...
   ETHEREUM_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
   MONGO_PASS=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster/db
   ```
3. **Run**
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Web UI ‚Üí http://localhost:4000  
   ‚Ä¢ Internal API ‚Üí http://localhost:4000/internal  
   ‚Ä¢ External API ‚Üí http://localhost:4000/api/v1  
   The bot signs-in to Telegram/Discord automatically.


## üõ†  Adding a New Tool

1. Create a `ToolDefinition` JSON describing inputs, outputs, cost & executionStrategy.  
2. Drop it into `src/core/tools/definitions/` (or register dynamically).  
3. Restart the app ‚Üí ToolRegistry auto-loads and:
   ‚Ä¢ Generates Telegram `/command`  
   ‚Ä¢ Appears in Web Canvas sidebar  
   ‚Ä¢ Exposed via `/api/v1/tools/registry` endpoint.

See `ADR-004-ToolRegistry` for full schema.
