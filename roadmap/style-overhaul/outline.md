# Frontend Style Overhaul — Outline

## Problem Statement
Current frontend styles are inconsistent and difficult to maintain. Designers and developers struggle to iterate quickly due to scattered CSS rules and lack of clear conventions. We need a process and tooling that let human & agent collaborators iteratively improve styling with precision and confidence.

## Vision
Establish a world-class, vanilla-CSS styling system powered by clear collaboration workflows. The system will allow:
1. Rapid inspection of live DOM elements via lightweight console scripts generated by the agent.
2. Centralised style tokens (CSS variables) and utility classes under `src/platforms/web/client/src/sandbox/style/`.
3. Strict conventions and documentation so future contributors can extend styles without regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A documented workflow for human ↔ agent style collaboration (see Guide).
- Console script boilerplate that, given a DOM selector, outputs computed style diagnostics.
- Refactored base styles to use CSS variables defined in `variables.css`.
- No breaking visual regressions in existing sandbox windows & public pages.
- ADR and implementation logs kept up-to-date per AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL_v3.
