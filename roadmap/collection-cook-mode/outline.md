# Collection Cook Mode â€” Outline

## Problem Statement
Legacy collection generator is a monolith tied to Telegram; we need a cross-platform, event-sourced cook orchestrator.

## Vision
Decoupled services (`CookOrchestrator`, `TraitEngine`, `Review`, `Export`) powered by spells/tools, surfaced via Web Sandbox modal and bot menus.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cook creation, pause/resume, and cancel through Web UI & API
- Trait tree editor with generated ranges support
- Real-time progress and approve/reject gallery
- Export to Cloudflare R2 producing metadata + images bundle
