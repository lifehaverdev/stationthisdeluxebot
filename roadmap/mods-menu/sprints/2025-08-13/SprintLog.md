# Sprint Log 2025-08-13

## Goals
1. Ship a clear visual indicator for private checkpoints in the Mods Menu (web sandbox).
2. Ensure private-path detection works even when `window.currentUserId` is missing.
3. Eliminate duplicate renders / icons and tidy CSS.
4. Update documentation (ADR & roadmap) to reflect changes.

## Progress Notes
- Day 1 (2025-08-13):
  * Added `isPrivate()` logic fallback â€“ detects any `checkpoints/users/` path.
  * Rendered inline `<span class="priv-icon">ðŸ”’</span>` next to heart button.
  * Removed pseudo-element and fixed duplicate lock rendering.
  * Tightened spacing via `.priv-icon` CSS rule.
  * Removed extra `fetchFavorites` call reducing one render.
  * Updated historical ADR (`vibecode`) and created new roadmap ADR `ADR-2025-08-13-private-checkpoint-lock.md`.
  * Confirmed single lock displays correctly in browser.

## Retrospective
**What went well**
- Rapid iteration with immediate visual feedback.
- Protocol v3 templates kept docs changes organised under `roadmap/`.

**Improvements**
- Need automated visual regression tests to catch icon placement issues.
- Still missing LocalStorage caching & search pagination â€“ schedule for next sprint.
