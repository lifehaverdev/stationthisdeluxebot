# Bug Hunt Log: Spell Final Generation Missing toolDisplayName

**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Severity**: S2 (Major feature broken)  
**Status**: FIXED  

## Summary
Spell execution failed at the final step when creating the final generation record due to missing required `toolDisplayName` field, causing spells to appear to hang without delivering final results.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Execute any spell (e.g., "lazyoni")
2. Spell steps execute successfully 
3. Final generation record creation fails with 500 error
4. User never receives final results

## Root Cause
In `src/core/services/WorkflowExecutionService.js` line 364-395, the `finalGenerationParams` object was missing the required `toolDisplayName` field when creating the final generation record for spell completion.

## Error Details
```
Error: toolDisplayName is required for generation records
    at GenerationOutputsDB.createGenerationOutput (/usr/src/app/src/core/services/db/generationOutputsDb.js:38:13)
```

## Fix Applied
Added `toolDisplayName` field to `finalGenerationParams` in `WorkflowExecutionService.js`:

```javascript
toolDisplayName: spell.name || `Spell ${spell.slug || (spell._id && spell._id.toString())}`,
```

This uses the spell's display name as the tool display name, with fallbacks to slug or ID if name is unavailable.

## Files Modified
- `src/core/services/WorkflowExecutionService.js` (line 369)

## Verification Steps
1. Execute a spell
2. Verify spell completes successfully 
3. Verify final results are delivered to user
4. Check that generation record is created with proper `toolDisplayName`

## Follow-up Tasks
- [ ] Test spell execution in production
- [ ] Monitor for any similar missing field issues in other workflow types
