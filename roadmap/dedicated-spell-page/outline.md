# Dedicated Spell Page â€” Outline

## Acceptance Criteria
- Public route `/spells/:slug` renders within <500 ms TTI
- Metadata, cost quote, and dynamic form load with a single API call
- Wallet connect + one-click payment integrated
- Execution progress streamed; output displayed
- Creator receives payout split via Referral Vault when applicable
