# HANDOFF: 2024-07-30

## Work Completed
1.  **Investigated Dynamic Command Requirements:** Analyzed `app.js` and existing web platform (`src/platforms/web/routes/index.js`) to understand how ComfyUI workflows are cataloged and executed using `WorkflowsService` and `ComfyUIService`.
2.  **Located Telegram Command Setup:** Identified `src/platforms/telegram/index.js` and `src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js` as key files for Telegram command registration.
3.  **Refactored Telegram Dynamic Command Registration (`dynamicCommands.js`):**
    *   Modified `setupDynamicCommands` to correctly accept the `services` object.
    *   Implemented logic to fetch workflows using `services.workflows.getWorkflows()`.
    *   Developed and iterated on filtering logic to identify "text-only" workflows suitable for Telegram commands, adapting to the actual `workflow.inputs` structure (array of input names).
    *   Updated command registration to use `bot.onText` with a refined regex (`^/${commandName}(?:@\\\\w+)?\\\\b(.*)`) to reliably capture arguments after the command.
    *   Ensured that the `prompt` (arguments) is correctly extracted from `match[1]`.
    *   Correctly retrieved `deploymentId` using `services.workflows.getDeploymentIdsByName()`.
    *   Ensured `comfyuiService.submitRequest()` is called with the correct parameters.
    *   Fixed handling of the `submissionResult` from `comfyuiService.submitRequest` to correctly identify a successful submission (when it returns a string `run_id`).
4.  **Corrected `setupDynamicCommands` Invocation:**
    *   Identified and resolved an issue in `src/platforms/telegram/index.js` where `setupDynamicCommands` was being called twice (once directly and once within the returned `async setupCommands()` method). The redundant direct call was removed.
5.  **Added Logging for Command Listing:** Implemented detailed logging around `bot.getMyCommands()` and `bot.setMyCommands()` to aid in diagnosing why dynamically created commands might not be appearing in Telegram's command list.
6.  **Achieved Successful Workflow Execution:** Dynamically generated Telegram commands (e.g., `/l4_t2i <prompt>`) can now successfully trigger ComfyUI workflow executions.
7.  **Diagnosed Command Listing Issue:** Identified that previous user-specific command settings (via `setCommandContext` in older bot logic) were overriding the new global command list for the primary test user. The global commands were being set correctly by `setupDynamicCommands` but were not visible to the user due to this scope override.
8.  **Implemented Temporary Fix for Command Visibility:** Added a temporary command `/clear_my_chat_commands` to `src/platforms/telegram/bot.js`. This command allows a user to clear any commands set specifically for their chat scope, enabling the global command list (including dynamic commands) to become visible to them after a Telegram client restart.

## Current State
*   The Telegram platform can now dynamically generate commands based on ComfyUI workflows that are identified as "text-only" (have a prompt input like `input_prompt` or `prompt`, and no image input like `input_image` or `image`).
*   These dynamic commands correctly parse arguments (prompts) provided by the user.
*   The system successfully submits these requests to the ComfyUI service and receives a `run_id`.
*   The user is notified that their request has been queued.
*   The issue of double command execution and double replies has been resolved.
*   A solution has been implemented to address the issue where the primary tester could not see the globally set dynamic commands due to a pre-existing user-specific command scope set by older bot logic. After using `/clear_my_chat_commands` and restarting the Telegram client, the global command list should be visible.

## Next Tasks
1.  **Verify Command Listing and Cleanup:**
    *   **Action:** User to execute `/clear_my_chat_commands` in their private chat with the bot, restart their Telegram client, and confirm that the dynamic commands (e.g., `/l4_t2i`) are now visible in the command list when typing `/`.
    *   Once confirmed, remove the temporary `/clear_my_chat_commands` handler from `src/platforms/telegram/bot.js`.

2.  **Diagnose and Fix Command Listing in Telegram (If Still an Issue After Scope Clear):**
    *   If dynamic commands are *still* not appearing globally after the chat-specific scope is cleared for the test user (and verified via @BotFather that the global list *is* set), then proceed with a deeper investigation using the logs from `bot.getMyCommands()` and `bot.setMyCommands()` as previously planned.
    *   Check for command name compliance and potential Telegram API restrictions.

3.  **Implement for Discord Platform:**
    *   **Action:** Create a similar dynamic command registration mechanism for the Discord platform.
    *   This will involve:
        *   Identifying or creating a `setupDiscordDynamicCommands(services)` function.
        *   Calling this function during Discord platform initialization in `app.js`, passing the `services` object.
        *   Inside `setupDiscordDynamicCommands`:
            *   Use `services.workflows.getWorkflows()` to get the workflow list.
            *   Filter for suitable workflows (e.g., text-only, or adapt to handle more complex inputs via Discord's slash command options).
            *   Register Discord slash commands for each suitable workflow.
            *   The handler for each slash command will extract inputs from Discord's interaction object, call `services.workflows.getDeploymentIdsByName()`, then `services.comfyui.submitRequest()`, and respond to the interaction.

4.  **Advanced Input Handling (Future Enhancement):**
    *   The current system assumes a single text input named `input_prompt`.
    *   **Action:** Enhance the system to dynamically determine required inputs for a workflow (perhaps using `services.workflows.getWorkflowRequiredInputs(workflowName)` as seen in web routes).
    *   Allow users to specify multiple inputs if a workflow requires them. This would be more straightforward with Discord slash command options. For Telegram, it might involve a more complex parsing scheme or a conversational approach to gather inputs.
    *   Integrate `services.workflows.validateInputPayload()` and `services.workflows.mergeWithDefaultInputs()` for more robust input handling.

5.  **Workflow Result Notification (Future Enhancement):**
    *   Currently, the user is only notified that the job is queued.
    *   **Action:** Investigate and implement a mechanism to notify the user (in Telegram/Discord) when the workflow is complete and provide the output/result. This might involve:
        *   Webhooks from ComfyUI Deploy if available.
        *   Polling `comfyuiService.getRunHistory()` or a similar status check method using the `run_id`.

## Changes to Plan
*   No major deviations from the implicit plan of enabling dynamic commands. The focus has been on iterative debugging and refinement of the Telegram implementation.

## Open Questions
*   What is the exact structure and content of the `existingCommands` array returned by `bot.getMyCommands()` in `dynamicCommands.js`?
*   Are there any specific error messages or behaviors observed from `bot.setMyCommands()` when it fails to update the command list? (The new logs should help answer this; also relevant if step 2 is needed).
*   Does clearing the chat-specific command scope for the test user resolve the command visibility issue? (Primary question for the next user action).
