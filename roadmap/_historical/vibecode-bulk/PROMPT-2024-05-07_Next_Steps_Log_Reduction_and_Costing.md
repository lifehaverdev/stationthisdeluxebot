# Agent Meta-Prompt: 2024-05-07

**Subject: Next Steps - Log Reduction and Machine Costing**

**Context:**

Significant refactoring of the `src/core/services/comfydeploy/` layer has been completed.

*   `comfyui.js` was broken down into smaller, focused managers (`runManager.js`, `fileManager.js`, `resourceFetcher.js`). See `HANDOFF-2025-05-06_ComfyUI_Refactor_Complete_Workflow_Next.md`.
*   `workflows.js` has been refactored, with all caching, fetching, and processing logic moved to `workflowCacheManager.js`. See `HANDOFF-2024-05-07_Workflows_Refactor_Complete.md`.
*   The overall structure and responsibilities within the `comfydeploy` service directory are documented in `src/core/services/comfydeploy/README.md`.
*   The application is currently functional.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Review Context:** Familiarize yourself with the recent handoffs (`HANDOFF-2024-05-07...`, `HANDOFF-2025-05-06...`), the `comfydeploy/README.md`, and the high-level goals in `REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md` and `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`.

2.  **Next Priorities:** The user has identified the following next steps:
    *   **Priority 1: Reduce Log Verbosity:** The `comfydeploy` services (especially the newly created `workflowCacheManager.js` and potentially others like `comfyui.js`) are currently producing excessive logs (e.g., detailed info logs for cache checks, structure parsing, etc.). Review the logging across these modules and reduce the verbosity, ensuring that only necessary information (warnings, errors, critical success messages) is logged by default. Info-level logs used for debugging during development should be commented out or removed.
    *   **Priority 2: Enhance Machine Info for Costing:** After log reduction, the next goal is to enhance the information retrieved about machines (via `_fetchMachines` in `workflowCacheManager.js` or potentially a dedicated method in `resourceFetcher.js`) to include details relevant for cost calculation (e.g., GPU type, pricing information if available from the API). This will likely involve inspecting the API response for available fields and potentially adjusting data structures.

3.  **Focus on Priority 1:** Begin by addressing the log verbosity (Priority 1). 
    *   Identify areas with excessive logging in `workflowCacheManager.js`, `comfyui.js`, `workflows.js`, and potentially their delegates (`runManager.js`, `resourceFetcher.js`, etc.).
    *   Propose changes to reduce the logging level for non-essential messages.
    *   Follow the incremental approach and user checkpoint guidelines from `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`.

4.  **User Confirmation:** Before starting the code modifications for log reduction, please confirm your understanding of the task and outline your initial plan for reviewing the logs.

**Status Update (Self):**

Priority 1 (Reduce Log Verbosity) is complete. Verbose `info`, `debug`, and `console.log` statements across the `comfydeploy` service files (`workflowCacheManager.js`, `comfyui.js`, `workflows.js`, `runManager.js`, `resourceFetcher.js`, `fileManager.js`) have been wrapped in `if (DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED)` checks. A `DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED` flag (defaulting to `false`) has been added to the top of each file. Critical logs (errors, warnings, key success messages) remain active. The application remains functional after these changes.

Priority 2 (Enhance Machine Info for Costing) is complete. The `_fetchMachines` method in `workflowCacheManager.js` has been updated:
*   A `GPU_COST_PER_SECOND` map has been added.
*   Fetched machines are now processed to include a `cost_per_second` field based on the `gpu_type` returned by the API.
*   A default (CPU) cost is applied and a conditional warning is logged if a machine's `gpu_type` is missing or not found in the map.
