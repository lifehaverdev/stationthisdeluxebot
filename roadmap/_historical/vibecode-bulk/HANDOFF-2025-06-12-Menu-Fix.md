# HANDOFF: 2025-06-12 - Debugging Menu Command Dependency Injection

## Work Completed

-   **Dispatcher Implementation**: Successfully refactored `src/platforms/telegram/dispatcher.js` to include a functional `CommandDispatcher`, `MessageReplyDispatcher`, and the previously missing `DynamicCommandDispatcher`.
-   **Dynamic Commands Restored**: Fixed the `on('message')` handler in `bot.js` to correctly use the new dispatchers, successfully restoring functionality for dynamic text commands (e.g., `/quickmake`).
-   **Manager Refactoring**: Updated `settingsMenuManager.js`, `modsMenuManager.js`, and `spellMenuManager.js` to use the new `registerHandlers` pattern, aligning them with the dispatcher architecture defined in ADR-012.
-   **Initial Debugging**: Made several attempts to fix a dependency injection issue preventing menu commands from working. This included correcting handler signatures and adding improved error logging.

## Current State

-   **BLOCKER: Menu Commands are Broken**. The primary commands for user-facing features (`/settings`, `/mods`, `/spells`) are all failing.
-   **Root Cause**: The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'post')` or `... is not a function` indicates that the `internalApiClient` dependency is `undefined` within the command handlers of the feature managers.
-   **Callbacks also Broken**: The `callback_query` handlers associated with these menus are also non-functional, very likely due to the same missing dependency.
-   **Injection Point of Failure**: The issue lies in how dependencies are passed from `app.js` into `bot.js` and then assembled in the `registerAllHandlers` function. Despite several attempts to correct the property path (`dependencies.internal`, `dependencies.internal.ApiClient`, `...dependencies`), the `internalApiClient` instance is not being correctly received by the handler functions.

## Next Tasks

1.  **Definitive Dependency Trace**: The immediate and only priority is to trace the `dependencies` object from its point of creation in `app.js` all the way to the `modsCommandHandler` in `modsMenuManager.js`. We must stop guessing and map the exact object structure.
2.  **Verify Injection in `bot.js`**: Add a temporary `console.log` or `logger.info` inside the `createTelegramBot` function in `bot.js` to print the keys of the received `dependencies` object. This will give us a definitive answer as to what properties are available.
3.  **Apply Correct Fix**: Based on the trace, apply the one correct fix to the `allDependencies` object in `bot.js`.
4.  **Full System Test**: Once a single command (e.g., `/mods`) is working, perform a full test of all menu commands and a sample of their callback functions to ensure the fix has resolved the issue globally.

## Open Questions

-   What is the precise structure of the `dependencies` object received by `createTelegramBot` in `bot.js`? Specifically, what is the correct key for the `internalApiClient` instance?
