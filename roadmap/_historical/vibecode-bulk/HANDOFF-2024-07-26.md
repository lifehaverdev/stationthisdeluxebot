# HANDOFF: 2024-07-26

## Work Completed
- **End-to-End LoRA Management Flow:** We built and refined a complete lifecycle for user-submitted LoRAs. This includes:
  - **Import:** Users can submit a LoRA from Civitai or Hugging Face via a URL in the Telegram bot.
  - **Moderation:** The submission automatically creates a database entry and notifies an admin, who can approve (publicly/privately) or reject it.
  - **Deployment:** On approval, the LoRA is now successfully deployed to the ComfyUI backend via the `comfydeploy.com` API. We resolved several bugs in the deployment payload to get this working.
  - **Deletion:** A new, admin-only feature allows for the complete deletion of a LoRA directly from the bot interface.

- **Usability & UX Enhancements:**
  - **Automated Cognates:** For LoRAs with extremely long trigger words, the system now automatically creates a short, usable cognate (shortcut) based on the model's slug.
  - **Telegram UI Fixes:** We resolved two critical UI bugs: a `BUTTON_DATA_INVALID` error by shortening callback data, and a Markdown parsing crash by implementing more robust text escaping. The cognate shortcuts are also now displayed in the LoRA detail view.

- **Live Cache Refresh:**
  - To solve stale data issues, the LoRA Trigger Map now uses an in-memory cache that is automatically refreshed whenever a LoRA is approved, rejected, or deleted. This ensures the bot's trigger-matching is always up-to-date without requiring a restart.

- **Implemented Startup Reconciliation**: Built the core logic in `CreditService` to handle missed `DepositRecorded` events upon application startup.
- **Event Processing**: The service successfully scans the Sepolia blockchain from the contract's deployment block, identifies past deposit events, and parses their data (`vaultAccount`, `user`, `token`, `amount`).
- **Collateral & Value Assessment**: The system now correctly uses the `TokenRiskEngine` and `PriceFeedService` to assess the risk of native ETH deposits, determine their USD value, and calculate the corresponding credit points to be awarded.
- **On-Chain Interaction**: The service attempts to execute the `confirmCredit` transaction on the `CreditVault` smart contract to finalize the deposit process.
- **Debugging & Diagnostics**: Resolved several on-chain interaction errors, including `no matching fragment` (incorrect function signature) and `InvalidEscrow()` (contract logic revert). Added diagnostic logging to read the contract's `custody` state to debug the latter.

## Current State
- The system is stable and the core LoRA import and management pipeline is fully functional.
- Admins can moderate incoming LoRAs and manage the existing library directly from Telegram.
- The LoRA trigger system is robust and stays synchronized with the database in near real-time.
- The reconciliation flow is functional up to the final on-chain confirmation step. It correctly finds an event and prepares the transaction.
- The `confirmCredit` call is currently failing. Our diagnostics revealed the root cause: the contract's `custody` mapping shows an escrow balance of `0` for the user, while the event we are processing has a non-zero `amount`. This mismatch causes the contract's `InvalidEscrow()` check to fail.
- The immediate cause of the on-chain state mismatch is that the signer wallet we are using is not authorized to interact with the contract's state.

## Next Tasks
- Implement the "Edit LoRA" functionality from the admin menu.
- Build out the "LoRA Store" functionality, including purchase/licensing logic via the `LoRAPermissionsDB`.
- Implement user notifications for when their submitted LoRA is approved or rejected.
- Create a follow-up job to remove the underlying model file from the storage volume when a LoRA is deleted via the admin menu.

As per your direction, we will address two configuration issues tomorrow before proceeding:

1.  **Correct Signer Private Key**: The `.env` file needs to be updated with the correct `SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY`. The current key is incorrect for the wallet that has deployment/operator permissions on the contract.
2.  **Authorize Operator**: The wallet corresponding to the correct private key must be explicitly authorized as an operator on the `CreditVault` contract. This is a required step before it can successfully call state-changing functions like `confirmCredit`.

Once these two items are addressed, we will restart the application and expect the `confirmCredit` transaction to succeed.

## Changes to Plan
- No major deviations from the high-level goals. Development has proceeded iteratively based on user supervision and feedback during live testing, as per the protocol.

## Open Questions
- What is the next development priority from the "Next Tasks" list, or is there another area to focus on?
- What is the procedure for authorizing a new operator on the `CreditVault` contract? (e.g., which function needs to be called by the contract owner?)
