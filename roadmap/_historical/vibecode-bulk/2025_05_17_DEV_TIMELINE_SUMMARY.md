**File:** `HANDOFF-2023-05-03.md`
- Implemented an initial internal and external API for application status (`/api/status`, `/api/status/health`).
- Refactored Discord and Telegram status commands to use this new internal API.
- Highlighted ongoing dependency injection issues with the new setup.

---

## ‚ú® 2025-05-05 ‚Äî WorkflowsService Initialization Refactor & Dynamic Routes Fix
**File:** `HANDOFF-2025-05-05_Workflows_Service_Refactor.md`

**File:** `vibecode/audits/2025_05_17_DEV_TIMELINE_SUMMARY.md` (This document)
- Analyzed handoff documents to reconstruct the development timeline.
- Identified key milestones, architectural shifts, and feature evolution.
- This summary aims to provide a chronological narrative of development decisions.
- Status: You are here.

---

## üß© Timeline Incomplete?
The following handoff files were analyzed and integrated into the timeline above. Review specific entries if more detail on their evolution (e.g., from "Noema" to "Internal API") is needed. All processed files appeared to contribute to the progressive development of the system.
- No specific handoff files from the `vibecode/handoffs/` directory seemed to be completely abandoned experiments without follow-up that would necessitate listing them separately here. Earlier concepts like "Noema" and the initial "Status API" evolved into the current "Internal API" structure.
