# HANDOFF: 2025-05-12

## Work Completed

This session focused on implementing the business logic for all stubbed API endpoints in the User Core service (`src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js`), based on `vibecode/handoffs/HANDOFF-2025-05-09.md` and `vibecode/decisions/ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md`. Additionally, a significant refactoring of the database service initialization was performed to ensure proper logger dependency injection.

**1. User Core API Endpoint Implementation & Testing (`src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js`, `src/core/services/db/userCoreDb.js`):**
    *   **`POST /users/find-or-create`**: Implemented and tested. Correctly returns `201 Created` for new users and `200 OK` for existing users, along with the `isNewUser` flag.
    *   **`GET /users/{masterAccountId}`**: Implemented and tested. Handles `ObjectId` validation, `404 Not Found`, and `200 OK` with `UserCoreObject`.
    *   **`PUT /users/{masterAccountId}`**: Implemented and tested. Handles `ObjectId` validation, payload validation, prevents updates to forbidden fields (e.g., `_id`, `platformIdentities`), and returns `200 OK` with the updated `UserCoreObject` or `404 Not Found`.
    *   **`GET /users/by-platform/{platform}/{platformId}`**: Implemented and tested. Handles path parameter validation, `404 Not Found`, and `200 OK` with `UserCoreObject`. A catch-all route (`GET /by-platform/*`) was added to provide consistent JSON `400 Bad Request` errors for malformed URLs.
    *   **Wallet Endpoints (`/users/{masterAccountId}/wallets`)**:
        *   **`POST /wallets` (Add Wallet)**: Implemented using `db.userCore.addWallet()`. Tested for successful additions, input validation (masterAccountId, wallet address), and `404` for non-existent users.
        *   **`PUT /wallets/{address}` (Update Wallet)**:
            *   Modified `userCoreDb.js`'s `updateUserCore` method to accept an `options` parameter for `arrayFilters`.
            *   Implemented to update `isPrimary`, `verified`, `name`, `tag`, and `updatedAt` for a wallet sub-document.
            *   Fixed a bug related to incorrect `BaseDB.findOne` arguments (`PRIORITY` vs. projection object) during pre-check.
            *   Tested successfully for updates and error handling.
        *   **`DELETE /wallets/{address}` (Delete Wallet)**:
            *   Added `deleteWallet(masterAccountId, walletAddress)` method to `userCoreDb.js` using `$pull`.
            *   Implemented with validation and pre-checks.
            *   Added a catch-all route (`DELETE /:masterAccountId/wallets/*`) for malformed URLs, returning JSON `400 Bad Request`.
            *   Tested successfully.
    *   **API Key Endpoints (`/users/{masterAccountId}/apikeys`)**:
        *   **`POST /apikeys` (Create API Key)**: Implemented API key generation (prefix, hash, full key), storage, and `201 Created` response showing the full key once. Tested successfully.
        *   **`GET /apikeys` (List API Keys)**: Implemented to return a "safe" representation of API keys (excluding hash). Tested successfully.
        *   **`PUT /apikeys/{keyPrefix}` (Update API Key)**:
            *   Added `updateApiKey(masterAccountId, keyPrefix, updates)` method to `userCoreDb.js` using `arrayFilters`.
            *   Implemented to allow updates to `name`, `permissions`, `status`, and `updatedAt`.
            *   Tested successfully after correcting an initial test failure due to an incorrect `keyPrefix`.
        *   **`DELETE /apikeys/{keyPrefix}` (Delete API Key)**:
            *   Added `deleteApiKey(masterAccountId, keyPrefix)` method to `userCoreDb.js`.
            *   Implemented the API endpoint with pre-checks and validation.
            *   Fixed an issue where `BaseDB.updateOne` was not returning the document as expected; updated `deleteApiKey` in `userCoreDb.js` to explicitly fetch the user doc after the update.
            *   Tested successfully.

**2. Database Service Logger Injection Refactor:**
    *   Identified and fixed a startup error (`TypeError: UserSessionsDB is not a constructor`) and a runtime error (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'debug')`) in DB service methods.
    *   **Root Cause**: DB service classes (e.g., `UserCoreDB`, `UserSessionsDB`) were being instantiated without a logger instance, or their `module.exports` were instances created without loggers.
    *   **Fix Implemented**:
        *   Modified all DB service classes (`userCoreDb.js`, `userSessionsDb.js`, `userEventsDb.js`, `generationOutputsDb.js`, `userEconomyDb.js`, `userPreferencesDb.js`, `transactionsDb.js`) to:
            *   Accept a `logger` in their constructor and store it as `this.logger` (with a console fallback).
            *   Export the class itself (e.g., `module.exports = UserCoreDB;`) instead of an instance.
        *   Updated `src/core/services/db/index.js` to export an `initializeDbServices(logger)` function. This function now imports the DB service *classes* and returns an object containing *instances* of these services, each created with the passed-in `logger`.
        *   Modified `src/core/services/index.js` within `initializeServices` to call `dbService.initializeDbServices(logger)` and pass these instantiated, logger-aware DB services to the API layer (`initializeAPI`).
    *   This ensures all database services are properly instantiated with a logger, resolving the errors.

## Current State

*   All User Core API service endpoints specified in `ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md` are fully implemented, tested via `curl`, and functioning correctly. This includes CRUD operations for users, wallets, and API keys, as well as the find-or-create and by-platform lookups.
*   Error handling for invalid input, not found resources, and malformed URLs (for GET/DELETE routes with specific path patterns) has been implemented, returning consistent JSON error responses.
*   The database service layer (`src/core/services/db/*.js`) has been refactored to correctly receive and utilize a logger instance, resolving startup and runtime errors.
*   The application starts up cleanly without the previous `TypeError` related to DB service constructors.

## Next Tasks

As per your request, the next steps will focus on continuing to build out the other internal API service endpoints:

1.  **Implement User Sessions API Service**:
    *   Create `src/api/internal/userSessionsApi.js` (if it doesn't exist or is a stub).
    *   Define and implement endpoints as per `ADR-003` (e.g., `POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{sessionId}`, `PUT /sessions/{sessionId}/end`, `GET /users/{masterAccountId}/sessions/active`).
    *   Ensure `userSessionsDb.js` methods are suitable and use the injected logger.
    *   Integrate its router into `src/api/internal/index.js`.
    *   Test endpoints thoroughly.

2.  **Iteratively Implement Remaining API Services**:
    *   For each of the other five services (User Events, User Economy, Transactions, User Preferences, Generation Outputs) outlined in `ADR-003`:
        *   Create/update the API service file (e.g., `userEventsApi.js`) in `src/api/internal/`.
        *   Define and implement its endpoints, utilizing the corresponding logger-aware DB service from `src/core/services/db/`.
        *   Integrate its router into `src/api/internal/index.js`.
        *   Verify routing and implement business logic with `curl` testing.

3.  **Refactor Platform Adapters & Core Workflows (Ongoing)**:
    *   Begin identifying and gradually updating platform adapters (`src/platforms/*`) and core workflows (`src/core/workflows/*`) to consume these new internal API endpoints instead of making direct calls to `services.db.data.*` objects. The `[Telegram] /noemainfome command` error noted during previous startups is a good candidate to revisit for this refactoring.

4.  **Authentication & Authorization (Future Major Task)**:
    *   Once a significant portion of the API services are in place, begin planning and implementing the "Per-Client API Key" strategy (Option 3 from `ADR-003`) for the internal API.

## Open Questions

*   Should the other DB service files (`userSessionsDb.js`, etc.) that now accept a logger also be updated to *use* `this.logger.debug/info/warn/error` for their internal console messages, similar to how `userCoreDb.js` was updated? (Currently, they only store the logger but might still use `console.log` internally).
    *   **Decision**: Yes. As each DB service (`*.js`) is touched during the implementation of its corresponding API service (`*Api.js`), any remaining `console.*` calls within the DB service methods should be updated to use the injected `this.logger`. This ensures consistent logging practices.
