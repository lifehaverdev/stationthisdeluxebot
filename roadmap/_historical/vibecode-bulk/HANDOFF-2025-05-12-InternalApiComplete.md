# HANDOFF: 2025-05-12 (Internal API Implementation Complete)

## Work Completed

This extensive session focused on implementing the seven internal API services defined in `ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md`, starting from the completion of the User Core API and the DB logger refactor (`vibecode/handoffs/HANDOFF-2025-05-12.md`).

**Key Milestones:**

1.  **Service Implementation (Iterative):**
    *   Implemented API endpoints and corresponding DB interactions for:
        *   User Sessions (`src/api/internal/userSessionsApi.js`)
        *   User Events (`src/api/internal/userEventsApi.js`)
        *   User Economy (initially in `userCoreApi.js`, later refactored)
        *   Transactions (`src/api/internal/transactionsApi.js`)
        *   User Preferences (`src/api/internal/userPreferencesApi.js`)
        *   Generation Outputs (`src/api/internal/generationOutputsApi.js`)
    *   Moved user-specific and session-specific endpoints from standalone services into `userCoreApi.js`, `userSessionsApi.js` as appropriate, following ADR-003 path structure.
    *   Implemented MongoDB transactions for atomic operations (e.g., credit/debit in User Economy).

2.  **`userCoreApi.js` Refactoring:**
    *   Successfully extracted Wallet, API Key, and User Economy logic into separate API service files:
        *   `src/api/internal/walletsApi.js`
        *   `src/api/internal/apiKeysApi.js`
        *   `src/api/internal/userEconomyApi.js`
    *   Updated `userCoreApi.js` to import and mount the routers for these extracted services.
    *   Manually removed the original code blocks from `userCoreApi.js` after automated attempts failed.

3.  **Comprehensive Test Script (`scripts/test_internal_api.sh`):**
    *   Created a bash script using `curl` and `jq` to test every endpoint across all seven services.
    *   The script creates a test user and related entities (session, event, wallet, key, etc.), performs CRUD operations, and checks for expected HTTP status codes and response data.
    *   Iteratively debugged and refined the script and underlying API/DB code to fix issues related to:
        *   Incorrect JQ paths for extracting IDs/data.
        *   Mismatched expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 vs 204).
        *   Incorrect argument passing to `BaseDB` methods (`findOne`, `findMany`, `insertOne`, `updateOne`) after signature changes, particularly regarding the `options` object and `session` parameter. This required fixes in `walletsApi.js`, `userEconomyDb.js`, `transactionsDb.js`, and `userCoreDb.js` (specifically `updateApiKey`).
        *   Incorrect API router mounting (`walletsApiRouter` was initially missed).
        *   Module import/export mismatches (`initializeUserEconomyApi`).

## Current State

*   All seven internal API services specified in `ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md` are implemented and functional.
*   `userCoreApi.js` has been significantly simplified by refactoring out Wallet, API Key, and User Economy logic.
*   A comprehensive integration test script (`scripts/test_internal_api.sh`) exists and passes, verifying all implemented endpoints work correctly in sequence.
*   The application starts cleanly and the database interactions, including transactions and array filters, are functioning as expected.

## Next Tasks

Based on `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md` and `REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md`:

1.  **Refactor Platform Adapters & Core Workflows:** Begin updating components in `src/platforms/*` and `src/core/workflows/*` to use the new internal API endpoints instead of direct `services.db.data.*` calls.
2.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Plan and implement the "Per-Client API Key" strategy (Option 3 from ADR-003) for the internal API.
3.  **Documentation:** Update project READMEs or create dedicated documentation for the internal API.
4.  **(Optional)** Enhance `scripts/test_internal_api.sh` with a cleanup step to delete the test user.

## Changes to Plan

*   No major deviations from the overall plan, but the refactoring of `userCoreApi.js` required more steps and manual intervention than initially anticipated due to tooling limitations.

## Open Questions

*   None at this moment regarding the internal API implementation itself. The next steps involve integrating it into the broader application.
