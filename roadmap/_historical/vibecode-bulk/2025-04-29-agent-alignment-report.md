# Agent Alignment Report - 2025-04-29

## Project Balance Analysis

| Artifact Type | Count | Observations |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Handoffs      | 40    | Heavily focused on platform-specific features and phase iterations |
| Maps          | 4     | Recent maps mostly focused on refactoring status |
| Decisions     | 2     | Limited architectural decision records (ADRs) |
| Prompts       | 4     | Few generated prompts, all recent |
| Active Plans  | Unclear | Limited clear active planning documents |

## Alignment Concerns Identified

1. **Mechanical vs. Strategic Balance**: The project has drifted toward mechanical handoff execution without sufficient strategic reflection
2. **Web Interface Direction**: Implementation is drifting toward traditional UI patterns rather than the specific, gamified vision
3. **Demonstration Gap**: Lack of small, testable chunks of frontend logic for visual evaluation
4. **North Star Alignment**: Need for updated guidance on demonstration-driven development

## User Reflection Summary

The user indicated the project is not entirely aligned with their vision:
- Technical implementation is impressive but emphasis has shifted too far toward mechanical handoff execution
- Web interface vision is specific and gamified, but implementation is drifting toward traditional UI patterns
- Desire for small, testable chunks of frontend logic for visual evaluation
- Need for implementation of the canvas system in demonstration-first mode

## Priority Adjustments

The following priorities were identified:
1. Implementing and testing the canvas tile system first
2. Getting authentication modal working (login, wallet, guest)
3. Attaching workflows to draggable tile instances
4. Making the canvas visible and testable with basic interactions

## Actions Taken

1. **Updated North Star Document**: Added a new section to the Web Frontend North Star document (`src/platforms/web/WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR.md`) focused on demonstration-driven development for Phase 4, emphasizing:
   - Interface-first implementation
   - Iterative delivery
   - Visual testing
   - Core feature priorities
   - Implementation process

2. **Created New Handoff**: Created a new handoff document (`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-PHASE4-WEB-CANVAS-DEMONSTRATION.md`) specifically focused on implementing the canvas system with a demonstration-first approach, including:
   - Canvas base implementation
   - Tile system basics
   - Authentication modal
   - Minimal HUD
   - Testing criteria
   - Deliverables

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Alignment Checks**: Schedule more frequent alignment reviews to ensure development stays on track with the vision
2. **Decision Documentation**: Create more architectural decision records (ADRs) to document key decisions
3. **Demonstration Milestones**: Establish clear demonstration milestones for frontend development
4. **Visual Testing Protocol**: Develop a protocol for visual testing and feedback of UI components
5. **Balance Reporting**: Periodically assess the balance between handoffs, maps, and decisions

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of the canvas demonstration as outlined in the new handoff
2. Schedule a follow-up review upon completion of the demonstration to validate alignment
3. Consider creating a more detailed ADR for the canvas implementation approach
4. Develop a visual testing framework for frontend components
