# HANDOFF: 2025-06-13 - Refactor Dependencies and Markdown Escaping

## Work Completed
-   **Dependency Tracing**: Successfully traced the `internalApiClient` dependency from `app.js` through `initializePlatforms`, `initializeTelegramPlatform`, and `createTelegramBot`.
-   **Endpoint Correction**: Corrected the `baseURL` for the primary `internalApiClient` instance to use the `/internal/v1/data` path, resolving initial `404` errors.
-   **Initial Refactor**: Attempted to enforce a consistent dependency injection pattern in `settingsMenuManager.js` and `spellMenuManager.js` by removing direct `internalApiClient` imports.
-   **Payload Fix**: Corrected the spell creation request in `spellMenuManager.js` to include the required `creatorId` field.

## Current State
-   **BLOCKER: Settings command is broken**. The refactor in `settingsMenuManager.js` was incorrect. The call to `getMostFrequentlyUsedTools` is failing because the `internalApiClient` dependency is not correctly passed down, resulting in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')`.
-   **BLOCKER: Telegram markdown escaping is fragile**. Creating a new spell fails when the confirmation message is sent (`âœ… Spell "animedirect" created!`). The `!` character is not escaped, causing a `400 Bad Request` from the Telegram API. This indicates a systemic need for a robust escaping solution.
-   **Conclusion**: The core dependency injection problem is not fully resolved, and a new systemic issue with API communication has been revealed.

## Next Tasks
1.  **Create a Messaging Utility Wrapper**:
    -   Create a new utility, perhaps in `src/platforms/telegram/utils/messaging.js`.
    -   This utility will export wrapper functions (e.g., `sendEscapedMessage`, `editEscapedMessageText`).
    -   These functions will take the `bot` instance and message parameters, automatically apply `escapeMarkdownV2` to the text, and then call the underlying `bot` method.
    -   Refactor all menu managers (`settings`, `spells`, `mods`, etc.) to use this new utility for all user-facing messages.

2.  **Definitive Dependency Pipeline Refactor**:
    -   Conduct a full audit of the dependency flow, starting from `app.js`.
    -   Establish a single, canonical `dependencies` object.
    -   Ensure this *one* object is passed down through `initializePlatforms` -> `initializeTelegramPlatform` -> `createTelegramBot` -> `registerAllHandlers`.
    -   Refactor all menu manager `registerHandlers` functions to accept the `dependencies` object.
    -   Propagate the `dependencies` object to every internal function within the menu managers that requires a dependency (e.g., `buildMainMenu`, `handleSettingsCallback`). This will eliminate all ambiguity and fix the remaining `TypeError`.

## Open Questions
-   Should the new messaging utility be a class or a collection of standalone functions?
-   What is the complete, authoritative list of dependencies that need to be available in the menu managers? (Current estimate: `bot`, `logger`, `internalApiClient`, `toolRegistry`, `userSettingsService`, `modsService`, `spellsService`, `replyContextManager`).

# HANDOFF: 2025-06-16 - Telegram Command & Menu System Restoration

## Work Completed

-   **Dependency Injection Overhaul**: Traced and fixed the dependency injection issues plaguing all menu handlers. The `internalApiClient` is now consistently available as `dependencies.internal.client`.
-   **Static & Dynamic Commands Restored**:
    -   Fixed `/status` by adding the correct `/internal` API prefix.
    -   Fixed all dynamic commands (e.g., `/quickmake`) by adding `deploymentId` where required and refactoring the handler to use a flexible `serviceMap` instead of hardcoded `if/else` logic.
-   **Menu Commands Restored**: All primary menu commands (`/train`, `/settings`, `/mods`, `/spells`, `/cast`) have been fixed. They now correctly resolve `masterAccountId` via the internal API before proceeding.
-   **Callback & Reply System Fixed**:
    -   Standardized all callback handlers to a `(bot, callbackQuery, masterAccountId, dependencies)` signature, with `masterAccountId` resolved by the dispatcher.
    -   Fixed the `MessageReplyDispatcher` by registering the missing handler for `settings_param_edit`, making the parameter editing flow functional.
-   **Settings Menu Fully Repaired**:
    -   Resolved `BUTTON_DATA_INVALID` errors by using the tool's `displayName` in callback data, keeping it short and valid.
    -   Fixed `getToolSettings is not a function` by implementing local helper functions (`getToolSettings`, `saveToolSettings`) that use the internal API client.
    -   Corrected a lookup mismatch where a function expected a `displayName` but received a `toolId`.
-   **Spell Menu Repaired**:
    -   Fixed an issue preventing the spell editor menu from loading by removing double Markdown escaping.

## Current State

-   **All Core Telegram Features are Functional**: From a user's perspective, the bot's command and menu systems are fully operational again. `/status`, `/settings`, `/mods`, `/spells`, `/train`, `/cast`, and all dynamic commands work as expected.
-   **Stable Architecture**: The dependency injection and event dispatching architecture is now stable and consistent across the Telegram platform adapter.
-   **Settings Editing Works**: Users can now navigate the settings menu, view their custom-set parameter values on buttons, and successfully edit and save new values.

## Next Tasks

1.  **Full Regression Test**: Perform a thorough test of all Telegram features to ensure no new bugs were introduced during the extensive refactor.
2.  **Review Tweak Flow**: The "tweak" functionality in the settings menu was not fully tested. This flow should be reviewed to ensure it's still working correctly after the recent changes.
3.  **Cleanup**: Remove any temporary `console.log` or `logger.info` statements added for debugging purposes.
4.  **Consolidate Settings Logic**: Consider refactoring other menu managers to use the new `get/save` settings helpers from `settingsMenuManager.js` if they have similar functionality, to keep the code DRY.

## Open Questions

-   Are there any less-common menu flows or sub-menus that were not covered and might still have issues?
-   Does the "Tweak generation" flow need the same dependency injection and handler signature fixes that were applied elsewhere?
