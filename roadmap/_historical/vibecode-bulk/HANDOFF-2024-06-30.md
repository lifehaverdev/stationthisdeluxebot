# HANDOFF: 2024-06-30

## Work Completed

### Workspace Interface Core Implementation
* **Custom Cursor System**:
  - Implemented pixelated cursor with ripple effect
  - Added black plus sign (+) for precision
  - Created water-themed interaction effects

* **Tool Window System**:
  - Developed minimalist, frosted-glass tool windows
  - Implemented progressive disclosure UI (show more/less parameters)
  - Added draggable functionality with smooth animations

* **Node Connection System**:
  - Created input/output anchors with type-specific icons (üñºÔ∏è, üìù, üéµ, üé¨)
  - Implemented drag-and-drop connection creation with visual feedback
  - Added flowing gradient animations for connection lines
  - Built smart filtering system for compatible tool connections

* **Tool Selection Modal**:
  - Implemented context-aware tool selection based on input/output types
  - Created categorized view of available tools
  - Added visual feedback and hover states
  - Integrated with the connection system

### Technical Foundations
* **Minimalist Framework**:
  - Built using vanilla JavaScript without external dependencies
  - Implemented custom component system for tool windows
  - Created efficient event handling system for drag operations

* **Type System**:
  - Developed robust type checking for tool inputs/outputs
  - Created mapping system for compatible tool connections
  - Implemented validation for connection creation

## Current State

The workspace interface now has a functioning prototype with:
- Tool window creation and management
- Visual connection system between tools
- Type-aware tool selection
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Basic interaction patterns established

The system follows the "ambient cognition field" aesthetic with:
- Frosted glass effects
- Flowing gradients
- Water-themed interactions
- Minimalist, monospaced typography

## Next Tasks

### 1. API Integration & Execution
- Implement authentication integration for tool execution
- Create API client for generation requests
- Add request/response handling to tool windows
- Implement proper error handling and status feedback

### 2. Output Display System
- Design and implement output display windows
- Create type-specific output renderers (image, text, audio, video)
- Add preview capabilities
- Implement output caching and management

### 3. Sandbox Overhaul
#### State Management
- Design database schema for sandbox state storage
- Implement state serialization/deserialization
- Create import/export functionality for state files
- Add auto-save capabilities
- Implement state versioning and history

#### Interface Enhancement
- Implement infinite canvas with zoom functionality
- Add pan and zoom controls
- Create minimap for navigation
- Implement node grouping and organization
- Add grid snapping and alignment tools
- Create optimized rendering for large node graphs

## Changes to Plan
The current implementation has stayed aligned with the minimalist frontend framework decision (ADR-014) while establishing the foundation for more complex features. The planned overhaul will require additional architectural decisions regarding state persistence and canvas management.

## Open Questions

### State Storage
- What metadata should be stored with each saved sandbox state?
- Should we implement collaborative features in the state system?
- How should we handle version conflicts in saved states?

### Performance
- What optimizations will be needed for large node graphs?
- How should we handle rendering of many simultaneous connections?
- What's the strategy for handling multiple active generations?

### UX Considerations
- How should we handle node organization for complex workflows?
- What navigation patterns work best for infinite canvas?
- How should we represent different zoom levels visually?
