# HANDOFF: 2025-05-16

## Work Completed

*   **Telegram Dynamic Command Refinement (`src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js`):**
    *   Updated classification logic to correctly identify `textInputKey` for tools with `type: "text"` (in addition to `"string"`), resolving issues with tools like "make" not being registered.
    *   Moved the `registeredCommands.push()` call to ensure the bot's command list is updated at startup.
    *   Implemented image handling for commands classified as `image_primary_with_text`, `image_only`, or `image_required_with_text`.
        *   Added `getTelegramFileUrl` utility to retrieve direct file URLs for replied-to images/documents.
        *   This utility is now in `src/platforms/telegram/utils/telegramUtils.js` and uses `dotenv` to load `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
    *   The system now correctly processes image inputs by passing the Telegram file URL to the `WorkflowsService`.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Updated `vibecode/docs/05-15-25-SPRINT.md` to reflect progress on Telegram integration.

## Current State

*   The `ToolRegistry` system is successfully integrated with `WorkflowCacheManager`.
*   `WorkflowsService` uses the `ToolRegistry`.
*   Telegram dynamic command generation in `dynamicCommands.js` leverages the `ToolRegistry` via `WorkflowsService`.
*   All 23 ComfyUI tools identified in recent logs are now classified and have execution paths in Telegram:
    *   Text-only commands are functional.
    *   Image-based commands (where users reply to an image) are functional, using the image URL as input.
*   The `getTelegramFileUrl` utility is refactored into `telegramUtils.js` and uses `dotenv` for `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` management.
*   The environment variable for the bot token in `telegramUtils.js` was corrected to `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.

## Next Tasks

*   **Testing:**
    *   Thoroughly test the recently implemented image command handling in Telegram across various image-based tools.
    *   Verify that text-only commands continue to function as expected.
    *   Confirm error handling (e.g., user doesn't reply to an image for an image command).
*   **Video Input Handling (Conditional):**
    *   If any ComfyUI workflows are intended to be triggered by replying to a *video* in Telegram:
        *   Ensure `ToolDefinition`s are correctly configured (`platformHints.primaryInput: 'video'`, appropriate video input key in `inputSchema`).
        *   Implement video file URL retrieval in `telegramUtils.js` (similar to `getTelegramFileUrl` for images).
        *   Add logic to `dynamicCommands.js` to handle `telegramHandlerType`s like `video_only`, `video_primary_with_text`.
*   **Review `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md` for phase advancement criteria if this sprint phase is considered complete.**

## Changes to Plan

*   No major deviations from the overall plan to integrate ComfyUI tools into `ToolRegistry` and update platform adapters. The Telegram adapter work is progressing as a follow-up to the core registry implementation.

## Open Questions

*   Does the ComfyUI backend (or the service layer calling it) reliably handle image URLs passed as input for all relevant image input nodes (e.g., `LoadImage`, `ImageUpload` nodes)? (Assumed true for current implementation).
*   Are there any other media types (audio, generic files) that need to be supported as direct inputs for Telegram commands in the near future?
