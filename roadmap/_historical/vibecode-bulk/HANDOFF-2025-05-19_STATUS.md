# HANDOFF: 2024-05-19

## Work Completed

1.  **Internal Status Report API Endpoint (`GET /internal/v1/data/users/:masterAccountId/status-report`):**
    *   Successfully created and tested a new internal API endpoint.
    *   The endpoint returns a user's points (converted from `usdCredit`), EXP (as an integer), active wallet address, and a list of live generation tasks.
    *   Live tasks include `idHash` (first 5 chars of SHA256 of task ID), `status`, `costUsd`, and `progressPercent` (or null).
    *   Pending tasks are filtered to those created within the last 24 hours.

2.  **Telegram `/status` Command Integration:**
    *   Updated `src/platforms/telegram/commands/statusCommand.js`.
    *   The command now calls the new internal status report API.
    *   Displays user's points, EXP (as a level and 7-segment progress bar: `âœ¨ Level X [ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ]`), wallet address, and a list of active tasks.

3.  **External API Endpoint for User Status (`GET /api/v1/me/status`):**
    *   Created a new public-facing API endpoint for users to get their own status.
    *   Authentication is handled via an `X-API-Key` header.
    *   **API Key Validation Sub-System:**
        *   Added `updateApiKeyLastUsed` method to `src/core/services/db/userCoreDb.js`.
        *   Enhanced `src/api/internal/apiKeysApi.js` to export a `performApiKeyValidation` function, which checks key existence, status, and updates `lastUsedAt`.
        *   Created a new internal endpoint `POST /internal/v1/data/users/apikeys/validate-token` within `src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js` that uses `performApiKeyValidation`.
    *   The external endpoint `userStatus.js` calls this internal validation endpoint.
    *   If authentication is successful, it calls the `GET /internal/v1/data/users/:masterAccountId/status-report` endpoint to fetch and return the user's status.

4.  **API Key Management & Testing:**
    *   Added `INTERNAL_API_KEY_ADMIN` to `app.js` for general internal API access.
    *   Successfully generated a new user-specific API key via `curl` to the internal `/apikeys` management endpoint.
    *   Successfully tested the `GET /api/v1/me/status` endpoint using the newly generated API key, confirming its functionality.

## Current State

*   The system now has a robust and unified internal mechanism for retrieving a comprehensive user status report.
*   The Telegram platform leverages this internal API to provide users with an enhanced `/status` command.
*   A secure, API-key authenticated external endpoint (`/api/v1/me/status`) is available for users to fetch their own status.
*   The necessary internal infrastructure for API key validation and management is in place and functional.
*   The `liveTasks` array in the status report is currently empty in test responses, which is expected as no recent, non-terminal tasks exist for the test user.

## Next Tasks

*   To be determined by user or the next phase of the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md.
*   Consideration for Discord `/status` command integration using the new internal status API, similar to the Telegram implementation.

## Changes to Plan

*   No significant deviations from the goals set out for this feature set. The plan evolved to include a dedicated internal API key validation endpoint for better modularity.

## Open Questions

*   None from the agent's perspective regarding the completed work.
