# HANDOFF: 2025-04-30

## Work Completed

Implemented the web interface with auth modal for the StationThis platform. The implementation:

1. Created/updated the necessary infrastructure for serving the client-side canvas application:
   - Updated `src/platforms/web/index.js` to serve the client bundle
   - Built the client application from the existing components
   - Created a missing `CollectionService.js` dependency
   - Fixed the client HTML file to properly load the bundle
   - Added direct file access routes for more reliable file serving

2. Connected the authentication flow:
   - The system now serves the auth modal on initial load
   - Users are prompted to log in, connect wallet, or continue as guest
   - The auth component communicates with the backend via the event system

3. Set up the front-end application structure:
   - Canvas-based UI with the water-themed background
   - Tile system for workflows
   - Authentication modal with three access methods

4. Added troubleshooting support:
   - Created a browser debug script to diagnose loading issues
   - Added a direct test page accessible at `/files/test`
   - Improved file serving with explicit routes

## Current State

The StationThis web platform now:
- Shows an authentication modal when accessing the site at localhost:4000
- Offers login, wallet connection, and guest access options
- After authentication, displays the canvas-based UI for workflows
- Follows the demonstration-first approach from our north star documents
- Provides direct access test pages for troubleshooting

## Demonstration

The web interface can be accessed at:
- Main Application: http://localhost:4000
- Direct Test Page: http://localhost:4000/files/test

The auth flow can be tested by:
1. Opening the direct test page
2. Using one of the test buttons (Login, Wallet, or Guest)
3. Observing the canvas interface appear after successful authentication

## Testing Instructions

To verify the auth modal and web interface:

1. Start the application using `node app.js`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/files/test` in a browser
3. Use any of the three test buttons to simulate authentication
4. Console output will provide detailed information about any loading issues

If the main application doesn't display properly, the direct test page is available to help diagnose the issue.

## Next Tasks

1. **Canvas Implementation**: Continue developing the canvas interaction system
2. **Workflow Tiles**: Connect workflow tiles to actual backend functionality
3. **UI Refinement**: Polish the styling and transitions
4. **State Persistence**: Add local storage for workspace state
5. **Playwright Tests**: Create Playwright tests for the web interface

## Technical Notes

1. The file serving has been improved with explicit routes:
   - `/files/test` - Direct test page
   - `/files/bundle.js` - Direct access to bundle.js
   - `/files/bundle.css` - Direct access to bundle.css
   - `/files/debug.js` - Direct access to debug script

2. The auth modal styling has been added to the main CSS file

3. If there are any MIME type issues, the direct file access routes should handle proper Content-Type headers

## Changes to Plan

This implementation aligns with the project's goal of providing a cross-platform interface with the canvas-based UI described in the REFACTOR_NORTH_STAR and WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR documents. No changes to the plans are required.

## Open Questions

1. Should the authentication modal be shown after session timeout, or should we refresh tokens automatically?
2. What additional visual feedback should be added for different authentication states?
3. Should we implement a tutorial overlay for first-time users of the canvas interface?
