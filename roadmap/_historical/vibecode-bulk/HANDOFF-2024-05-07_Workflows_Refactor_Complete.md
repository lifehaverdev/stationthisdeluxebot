# HANDOFF: 2024-05-07 - Workflows Service Refactor Complete

## Work Completed

*   **Refactored `workflows.js`:**
    *   Created `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflowCacheManager.js`.
    *   Migrated all logic related to fetching (deployments, machines, workflows, details), processing, indexing, and caching from `workflows.js` into `workflowCacheManager.js` incrementally.
    *   Moved core cache properties (`cache` object), state (`isLoading`, `isInitialized`, etc.), and methods (`_clearCache`, `_isCacheStale`, `initialize`, `ensureInitialized`, `_fetch*`, `_process*`, `_get*`, `_buildIndexes`) to `WorkflowCacheManager`.
    *   Updated `workflows.js` to instantiate and delegate all cache management and data loading/fetching tasks to `workflowCacheManager.js`.
*   **Reduced Code Size:** Significantly reduced the line count and complexity of `workflows.js`, clarifying its role as a public API layer for workflow information.
*   **Testing:** Confirmed application functionality remains intact after the refactoring.

## Current State

*   `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflows.js` now primarily acts as an interface, providing public methods to access workflow data.
*   `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflowCacheManager.js` encapsulates all the logic for interacting with the ComfyDeploy API to fetch, process, cache, and index workflow-related data.
*   The separation improves modularity and maintainability of the workflow service.
*   The application is functional.

## Next Tasks

*   This specific refactoring task (breaking down `workflows.js`) is complete.
*   Awaiting user direction for the next priority based on the overall project plan (`REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md` and phases).

## Changes to Plan

*   None. This work directly addressed the planned refactoring of `workflows.js` outlined in the previous handoff (`HANDOFF-2025-05-06`).

## Open Questions

*   None at this time related to this refactoring task.
