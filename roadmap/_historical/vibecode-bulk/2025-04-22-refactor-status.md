# Refactor Status Report - 2025-04-22

## Current Phase
**Phase 3: Workflow and Interaction Refactoring** (In Progress)

## Recently Completed Tasks
- ✅ Implementation of `WorkflowModel` for workflow execution and state management (31 passing tests)
- ✅ Implementation of `WorkflowEngine` for workflow type registration and instance creation
- ✅ Implementation of `WorkflowService` for workflow persistence and orchestration (28 passing tests)
- ✅ Migrated `/make` command with comprehensive E2E tests
- ✅ Implemented media commands with full E2E test coverage
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for `/make` command in `tests/commands/makeCommand.e2e.test.js`
- ✅ Consolidated workflow implementations to follow clean architecture principles

## Next Uncompleted Task
**Account Command Migration and Testing**
- Focus on migrating account commands to the new architecture
- Create comprehensive tests for account management commands
- Address test coverage gaps for account points management, settings, and preferences
- Create tests in `tests/commands/accountCommands.test.js`

## Blocking Issues for Phase 4
1. **Account Command Testing**
   - Account management commands have insufficient test coverage
   - Need tests for account points management, settings, and preferences

2. **Service Layer Test Coverage**
   - Critical services lack test coverage
   - 6/8 services in `src/services/` have no tests

3. **UI Component Integration Tests**
   - Integration with workflow engine is not tested
   - Missing tests for platform-specific rendering adapters

4. **Consistent Test Location**
   - Tests are split between `tests/` and `src/core/*/tests/` directories
   - Need standardized test location and naming conventions

## Implementation Context
The account command migration is part of the broader workflow and interaction refactoring in Phase 3. 
It's a high-priority task that's required to be completed before moving to Phase 4. The account 
commands handle critical functionality related to user accounts, points management, settings, and 
preferences.

The migration should follow the patterns established with the successful migrations of the `/make` 
and media commands, which have been fully implemented with comprehensive E2E tests. The account 
commands should leverage the workflow system for multi-step interactions and follow the clean 
architecture principles that have been established.

## Readiness for Phase 4
The following items need to be completed before moving to Phase 4:
- [ ] Test coverage for account management commands
- [x] Test coverage for image generation pipeline
- [ ] Test coverage for UI component integration with workflows
- [ ] Test coverage for all critical services
- [ ] Standardized test organization
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect current architecture
- [ ] Feature flags in place for gradual rollout
