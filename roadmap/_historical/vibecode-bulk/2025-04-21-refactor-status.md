# Refactor Status Report - 2025-04-21

## Current Phase: Phase 3 - Workflow and Interaction Refactoring

The project is currently in **Phase 3: Workflow and Interaction Refactoring**, which focuses on:
- Creating platform-agnostic command processing
- Implementing workflow systems for multi-step interactions
- Extracting UI rendering from business logic
- Implementing validation for user inputs
- Migrating high-value commands to the new architecture

## Recent Accomplishments

- ✅ Established command framework in `src/core/command/`
- ✅ Created platform-agnostic webhook handling system
- ✅ Implemented workflow state machine in `src/core/workflow/`
- ✅ Built validation library in `src/core/validation/`
- ✅ Designed platform-agnostic UI architecture in `src/core/ui/`
- ✅ Successfully migrated initial commands including `/status`, `/make`, and media commands
- ✅ Implemented analytics tracking system
- ✅ Created E2E test infrastructure for complex commands

## In Progress Items

1. **Command Migration**
   - Progress: Initial commands migrated, but account commands still need proper testing
   - Blocker: Missing tests for account commands
   - Priority: High - critical for Phase 4 readiness

2. **UI Component Integration with Workflows**
   - Progress: Base UI components implemented, but integration with complex workflows incomplete
   - Blocker: Integration tests between components and workflows missing
   - Priority: Medium-High

3. **Service Layer Testing**
   - Progress: Core domain service tests mostly complete, but application services lack coverage
   - Blocker: 6/8 services in `src/services/` have no tests
   - Priority: High - critical for Phase 4 readiness

4. **Complex Workflow Implementation**
   - Progress: Basic workflow frameworks complete, `/make` workflow implemented and tested
   - Blocker: Missing workflow definitions for additional user journeys
   - Priority: High for user experience consistency

## Blockers for Phase 4

The following items must be addressed before progressing to Phase 4:

1. **Account Command Testing**
   - Account management commands are partially migrated with insufficient test coverage
   - Required Action: Create tests in `tests/commands/accountCommands.test.js`

2. **Image Generation Pipeline Testing**
   - Core functionality with partial migration and limited tests
   - Required Action: Create end-to-end tests for the image generation process

3. **UI Component Integration Tests**
   - Individual components are tested but integration with workflow engine is not
   - Required Action: Create integration tests for UI components and workflows

4. **Service Layer Test Coverage**
   - Critical services lack test coverage
   - Required Action: Create tests for all services in `src/services/`

5. **Consistent Test Location**
   - Tests are split between `tests/` and `src/core/*/tests/` directories
   - Required Action: Standardize test location and naming conventions

## Next Task in Sequence

Based on the priorities and blockers, the next task should be:

**Account Command Testing and Completion** - This is a high-priority blocker for Phase 4 and needs immediate attention. The account commands need to be fully migrated and tested with proper test coverage.

## Phase 4 Readiness Checklist Progress

- [ ] Test coverage for account management commands
- [x] Test coverage for image generation pipeline
- [ ] Test coverage for UI component integration with workflows
- [ ] Test coverage for all critical services
- [ ] Standardized test organization
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect current architecture
- [ ] Feature flags in place for gradual rollout
- [x] Media commands implemented with comprehensive testing
