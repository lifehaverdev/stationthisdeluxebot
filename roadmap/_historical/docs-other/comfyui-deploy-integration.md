# ComfyUI Deploy Integration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks progress on integrating StationThis directly with the ComfyUI Deploy platform, replacing the internal database with the ComfyUI Deploy API as the primary source of truth.

## Phase 1: Core Services Update

### ComfyUI Service (src/core/services/comfyui.js)
- [x] Add webhook support for status updates
- [x] Expand API client to include all relevant ComfyUI Deploy endpoints:
  - [x] GET/POST `/run` - Run workflows and get results
  - [x] GET `/upload-url` - Generate pre-signed URLs for file uploads
  - [x] POST `/workflow` - Upload workflow definitions
  - [x] GET/POST `/deployment` - List and create deployments
  - [x] GET `/machine` - List registered machines
- [x] Improve error handling and retry logic
- [x] Add helper methods for file upload
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing for API client

### Workflows Service (src/core/services/workflows.js)
- [x] Modify to use ComfyUI Deploy API as the primary source of truth
- [x] Improve caching mechanism with proper invalidation
- [x] Add database fallback for offline operations
- [x] Extract workflow input requirements
- [x] Map deployments to workflows
- [x] Build lookup indexes for efficient access
- [x] Add machine management capabilities
- [ ] Add monitoring of workflow status

### Media Service (src/core/services/media.js)
- [ ] Integrate with ComfyUI Deploy file upload endpoints
- [ ] Support pre-signed URLs for file uploads
- [ ] Handle image downloads from ComfyUI Deploy
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed media

## Phase 2: Workflow Implementation Updates

### makeImage Workflow
- [ ] Update to use enhanced ComfyUI service
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add progress tracking using ComfyUI Deploy status endpoints

### trainModel Workflow
- [ ] Connect to ComfyUI Deploy for model training operations
- [ ] Implement async status checking
- [ ] Track training progress through API

### collections.js
- [ ] Store collection data with references to ComfyUI Deploy entities
- [ ] Add validation against ComfyUI Deploy workflows

## Phase 3: Platform Adapters Updates

### Telegram Commands
- [ ] Update command handlers to use new services
- [ ] Modify rendering for ComfyUI Deploy-specific outputs
- [ ] Add new commands for ComfyUI Deploy features

### Discord Commands
- [ ] Similar updates for Discord platform

### Web Interface
- [ ] Create direct integration with ComfyUI Deploy UI
- [ ] Implement shared session management

## Completed Tasks

### 2023-12-15
- Created integration plan document (docs/handoffs/COMFYUI_DEPLOY_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)
- Enhanced ComfyUI service with complete API client capabilities
- Added webhook support for real-time updates
- Added file upload functionality through pre-signed URLs
- Added deployment and machine management endpoints

### 2023-12-16
- Refactored Workflows service to use ComfyUI Deploy API as source of truth
- Implemented efficient caching with TTL and invalidation
- Added database fallback for offline operation
- Added proper workflow and deployment indexing
- Implemented machine management functionality

## Next Tasks

1. Update the Media service to integrate with ComfyUI Deploy file handling
2. Modify the makeImage workflow to use the enhanced ComfyUI service
3. Add tests to validate API integrations
4. Update platform adapters to use the new services

## Blockers and Issues

- Need to determine how to handle webhook URLs in deployed environments
- May need to adjust caching strategy based on deployment environment (memory constraints)
- Consider rate limiting strategies for API calls

## Notes

- The ComfyUI Deploy API is still evolving, so we should monitor for changes
- Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for API calls to prevent cascading failures
- Need to verify authentication token handling in various environments
