# ComfyDeploy Prompt Handling Fix

## Issue Summary

The ComfyDeploy integration was experiencing issues with prompt handling, particularly:

1. User prompts were not being properly passed to the API (sending empty strings or just commas)
2. Unnecessary parameters were being sent to the API (internal metadata that wasn't needed)
3. The deployment ID was not being properly set in the API request

The root cause was an overengineered parameter normalization system that was attempting to compose prompts from multiple sources instead of simply using the original prompt provided by the user.

## Fix Overview

We've made several key changes to the prompt handling system:

1. Modified `_processPromptText()` in `PromptBuilder.js` to prioritize using the original input prompt instead of composing a new one
2. Enhanced `_finalizeRequest()` to ensure the correct prompt is sent to the API by implementing a clear priority order
3. Fixed the property name for deployment ID from `deploymentId` to `deployment_id` to match what the ComfyClient expects

## Implementation Details

### Priority Order for Prompt Text

The system now uses the following priority order to determine which prompt to send:

1. `settings.inputs.input_prompt` - Direct input from API parameters (highest priority)
2. `settings.input_prompt` - Alternative location for input prompt 
3. `settings.prompt` - Generic prompt parameter
4. `promptObj.prompt` - Original prompt from the request
5. Composition - Only as a fallback (lowest priority)

### Prompt Parameter Tracing

We've added detailed logging to trace the origin of the prompt text throughout the process:

- Console logs show which source the prompt came from
- A debug log displays the final prompt value being used
- Parameter origin tracking helps identify how the system chose the final prompt

### Parameter Filtering

Additionally, we've improved the parameter filtering system:

- The `_filterToRequiredParameters()` method ensures only necessary parameters are sent
- Parameters are properly prefixed with `input_` for API consistency
- Default values are applied only when needed

### API Structure Compatibility

We've made sure the final request structure matches what the ComfyDeploy API expects:

- The deployment ID is now correctly set as `deployment_id` instead of `deploymentId`
- All input parameters are properly prefixed with `input_`
- The request structure follows the expected format: `{deployment_id, inputs, metadata}`

## Testing

We've created comprehensive tests for the fix:

1. Unit tests in `PromptBuilder.test.js` verify the priority system works correctly
2. A manual test script in `manual-test.js` can be run to validate the behavior with realistic requests
3. The original issue with "MAKE" workflow and empty prompts has been specifically tested

## How to Verify the Fix

Run the manual test script to verify prompt handling:

```powershell
node src/services/comfydeploy/manual-test.js
```

Or run the unit tests:

```powershell
npx jest tests/services/comfydeploy/PromptBuilder.test.js
```

## Future Improvements

For future maintenance:

1. Further simplify the parameter handling system
2. Add more validation for required parameters
3. Consider centralizing parameter preprocessing in one location instead of spreading it across multiple methods
4. Document the expected parameter format for API integration
