## Notes

- Routes defined using NextJS App Router format are derived from the file structure
- Some endpoints may require additional verification, especially those with dynamic segments
- The `Suspicious or Complex Endpoints` section lists routes that were detected through indirect means
- The `Manually Added Endpoints` section contains endpoints added from scripts\additional-endpoints.json
- Runtime information was gathered from https://api.comfydeploy.com with prefix /api
