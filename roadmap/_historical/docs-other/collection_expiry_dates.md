## Implementation Details

### Expiry Date Model
- Implemented a standardized expiry date model:
  - Set through a dropdown with common periods (1-90 days)
  - Stored on the backend as an ISO date string
  - Displayed to users as a formatted date with days remaining
  - Color-coded indicators when approaching expiration

### Web UI Implementation
- Enhanced the `CollectionSharingComponent` with:
  - Expiry date selection when creating a new share link
  - Display of current expiry date for existing links
  - Interface for updating expiry dates
  - Visual indicators for approaching expiry
  - Success notifications for expiry-related actions

### Backend Integration
- Integrated with backend API endpoints:
  - GET `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link/status` - Returns link with expiry
  - POST `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link` - Creates link with expiry
  - PATCH `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link/expiry` - Updates expiry date

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows the platform-agnostic approach outlined in the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, with all business logic related to expiry dates contained in shared workflows and only UI-specific code in the web platform components.

Key aspects of the implementation:
- Used the custom component system in accordance with WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR.md
- Maintained the existing event handling patterns
- Followed established styling conventions
- Added user-friendly feedback for expiry-related actions
- Implemented date calculations and formatting client-side

## User Flow

1. **When creating a share link**:
   - User selects expiry period from dropdown
   - System creates link with specified expiry
   - User receives confirmation and sees expiry information
   - Link remains valid until expiry date

2. **For viewing expiry information**:
   - User sees formatted expiry date
   - User sees days remaining until expiry
   - System highlights expiry when approaching (â‰¤3 days)

3. **For updating expiry date**:
   - User selects new expiry period from dropdown
   - User clicks update button
   - System updates expiry date and shows confirmation
   - User sees updated expiry information

## Next Steps

1. **Discord Platform Integration**
   - Add expiry date functionality to Discord commands
   - Create equivalent notifications and feedback in Discord
   - Ensure consistent behavior between web and Discord platforms

2. **Telegram Platform Integration**
   - Add expiry date functionality to Telegram commands
   - Implement expiry info and update commands in Telegram
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all platforms

3. **Expiry Notification System**
   - Create a notification mechanism for approaching expiry
   - Implement email notifications or in-app alerts
   - Add workflow for handling expired links

## Notes

This implementation completes the expiry dates feature for collection sharing, enhancing the security and flexibility of the sharing system. The UI is designed to be intuitive and follows the principles outlined in the WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR.md document.

The feature provides a more sophisticated sharing model that allows time-limited access to collections, which was one of the enhancement goals identified in the previous handoff document (HANDOFF-PHASE4-COLLECTION-PERMISSIONS-FEEDBACK.md).

User experience has been significantly improved with clear expiry information and feedback mechanisms, making the sharing functionality more secure and manageable.
