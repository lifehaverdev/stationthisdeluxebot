   - [x] Modal-based result viewer
   - [x] Multi-tab interface (View, Share, Export)
   - [x] Type-specific content rendering
   - [x] Collection saving integration
   - [x] Share functionality
   - [x] Download and export options

2. **Content Type Viewers**
   - [x] Image viewer with metadata display
   - [x] Text viewer with formatting
   - [x] Audio player with controls
   - [x] Video player with controls
   - [x] Model data display
   - [x] Generic data viewer

3. **Sharing Features**
   - [x] Shareable link generation
   - [x] Social media integration
   - [x] Copy to clipboard functionality

4. **Export Capabilities**
   - [x] Format selection based on content type
   - [x] Download original file
   - [x] Export interface with format selection

5. **Collection Integration**
   - [x] Collection selection dropdown
   - [x] Save to collection functionality
   - [x] Error handling for collection operations

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation follows the architectural principles from the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN:

1. **Component-Based Design**
   - Modular ResultViewerComponent with clear responsibilities
   - Event-driven communication using the EventBus
   - Clean separation of concerns between content display and actions

2. **UI Implementation**
   - Modal interface consistent with the web platform style
   - Responsive design for different content types
   - Tab-based organization for improved user experience

3. **Practical Approach**
   - Direct DOM manipulation without heavy frameworks
   - Simple state management within component
   - Event delegation for efficient event handling

4. **Extensibility**
   - Support for multiple content types with specialized viewers
   - Easy addition of new export formats
   - Pluggable collection integration

## Current Status

The Result Handling Enhancement is fully implemented and supports:

- Viewing results of different content types (image, text, audio, video, model)
- Saving results to collections
- Sharing results via links and social media
- Exporting results in different formats
- Downloading original files

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for large content
   - Add caching for frequently used resources
   - Optimize rendering for very large files

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Add annotation tools for image results
   - Implement side-by-side comparison for results
   - Create batch operations for multiple results
   - Add advanced filtering options

3. **Integration Improvements**
   - Connect with other workflow tiles for result processing
   - Implement history tracking for result changes
   - Add favorites and categorization system

## Implementation Approach

The Result Handling Enhancement was implemented following a content-first approach:

1. **Core Modal First**
   - Implemented the base modal structure and styling
   - Added tab-based navigation
   - Created container for content-specific viewers

2. **Content Type Specialization**
   - Developed specialized viewers for different content types
   - Implemented metadata display for rich content
   - Created consistent styling across viewers

3. **Action Integration**
   - Added collection saving functionality
   - Implemented sharing capabilities
   - Created export and download features

## Testing Instructions

To test the Result Viewer component:

1. Create a workflow tile on the canvas
2. Configure and execute the workflow
3. Click "View Results" when execution completes
4. Test the different viewer tabs (View, Share, Export)
5. Try saving to a collection
6. Test sharing functionality
7. Attempt to export and download results

## Notes and Considerations

- The component handles multiple content types with specialized viewers
- Collection integration uses the existing CollectionService
- Export formats are determined based on content type
- Share links are placeholders that would connect to a real sharing service in production

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - Add commenting system for results
   - Implement shared viewing sessions
   - Create edit history tracking

2. **Advanced Media Processing**
   - Add in-place editing for image results
   - Implement transcription for audio/video
   - Create AI-powered content analysis

3. **Integration Ecosystem**
   - Add plugins for external services
   - Implement result publication to marketplaces
   - Create integration with social platforms
