No significant blockers identified at this time.

## Notes

The implementation follows the platform-agnostic approach outlined in the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md document. All business logic for collection sharing is kept in the workflow layer, with only UI-specific rendering in the platform adapter.

This feature enables collaboration between users and simplifies sharing collections across different user accounts, enhancing the social aspects of the StationThis bot platform.
