# Agent Progress Log

## Initial Survey - [Date: Current]

1. Created basic documentation folder structure:
   - `/docs/comfyui-deploy/README.md` - Project summary
   - `/docs/comfyui-deploy/API/API_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level API overview
   - `/docs/comfyui-deploy/SETUP/LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Local dev setup guide
   - This progress log

2. Completed initial survey of codebase structure:
   - Main repository components:
     - `/web` - NextJS frontend and backend
     - `/web-plugin` - ComfyUI plugin for machine connection
     - `/example_workflows` - Sample workflows
     - `/comfy-nodes` - Custom ComfyUI nodes

3. Key web application components identified:
   - NextJS app with API routes
   - Authentication via Clerk
   - Database with Drizzle ORM
   - S3/R2 storage for workflow files and outputs

## Documentation Progress - [Date: Current]

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Created API endpoint list in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/API/ENDPOINTS_LIST.md`
   - Created sample API requests in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/API/SAMPLE_REQUESTS.md`
   - Documented authentication flow

2. **Component Documentation**:
   - Created component overview in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/COMPONENTS/COMPONENTS_OVERVIEW.md`
   - Created Auth module documentation in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/COMPONENTS/MODULES_BREAKDOWN/Auth.md`

3. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Completed local setup guide in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/SETUP/LOCAL_SETUP.md`
   - Documented environment variables in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/SETUP/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
   - Created deployment guide in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/SETUP/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

4. **Notes and Gaps**:
   - Identified documentation gaps and TODOs in `/docs/comfyui-deploy/NOTES/GAPS_AND_TODOS.md`

## API Endpoint Scraper Development - [Date: Current]

1. **Created Endpoint Scraper Script**:
   - Developed a Node.js script to automatically detect API endpoints in the codebase
   - Located at `/scripts/scrapeEndpoints.js`
   - Added documentation on how to use the script in `/scripts/README.md`

2. **Scraper Features**:
   - Scans multiple directories for API route definitions
   - Detects various routing patterns:
     - Hono OpenAPI route definitions
     - Standard HTTP method definitions
     - NextJS App Router routes
     - Route registration functions
   - Extracts method, path, file location, and summary if available
   - Identifies "suspicious" routes that require manual verification

3. **Scraper Output**:
   - Generates a comprehensive Markdown table of endpoints at `/docs/comfyui-deploy/API/AUTOMATED_ENDPOINTS_SCRAPE.md`
   - Updates the GAPS_AND_TODOS.md file with scraping results

4. **Initial Execution Results**:
   - Created a sample output file showing expected results format
   - The script is ready to be run on the live codebase

## OpenAPI Specification Integration - [Date: Current]

1. **Created OpenAPI Specification Fetcher Script**:
   - Developed a Node.js script to automatically fetch and parse the official OpenAPI spec
   - Located at `/scripts/fetchOpenApiEndpoints.js`
   - Script fetches the latest spec from https://api.comfydeploy.com/internal/openapi.json

2. **Script Features**:
   - Fetches the OpenAPI specification from the official API endpoint
   - Parses all API endpoints, methods, parameters, and schemas
   - Extracts comprehensive details about each endpoint:
     - HTTP Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
     - Path
     - Summary and Description
     - Parameters (path, query, header)
     - Request body schemas
     - Security requirements
   - Organizes endpoints by tag (resource type)

3. **Script Output**:
   - Generates a human-readable Markdown document at `/docs/comfyui-deploy/API/OPENAPI_ENDPOINTS_LIST.md`
   - Creates a structured JSON document at `/docs/comfyui-deploy/API/OPENAPI_ENDPOINTS_LIST.json`
   - Produces a schema summary document at `/docs/comfyui-deploy/API/SCHEMAS_SUMMARY.md`

4. **Benefits of OpenAPI Integration**:
   - Provides a single source of truth for all API endpoints
   - Ensures documentation accurately reflects the actual API implementation
   - Includes complete parameter details and request/response schemas
   - Can be re-run periodically to keep documentation in sync with API changes

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Use the OpenAPI-based endpoint list as the canonical reference for all API integrations
   - Periodically re-fetch the specification to keep documentation current
   - Extend the script to generate client code or additional documentation formats if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Module Documentation**:
   - Create documentation for remaining modules:
     - Workflow
     - Machines
     - Storage
     - Database

2. **API Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Execute the endpoint scraper on the complete codebase
   - Update API endpoints documentation with newly discovered endpoints
   - Create more comprehensive integration examples

3. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Document workflow execution lifecycle

4. **Advanced Configuration**:
   - Document advanced deployment scenarios
   - Create troubleshooting guide
