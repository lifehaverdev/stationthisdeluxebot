## Current State

### Repository Structure
The web collection sharing functionality has been implemented across these components:

```

  platforms/
    web/
      index.js                       # Web platform entry point

### Implementation Details

The web collection sharing implementation follows these key design principles:
- Platform-agnostic business logic with platform-specific UI
- RESTful API design for consistent access patterns
- Secure authentication using JWT
- Reuse of existing collections workflow
- Separate entry point to maintain backward compatibility

The main components are:

1. **Web Platform Structure**:
   - Express-based web server with middleware configuration
   - JWT-based authentication system
   - Route organization for API endpoints

2. **Collection Sharing API**:
   - Endpoints for user-to-user sharing
   - Share link generation and management
   - Access control with proper authentication
   - Integration with platform-agnostic workflows

3. **New Application Entry Point**:
   - Created app.js as a modern entry point
   - Preserves legacy server.js without modifications
   - Properly initializes all refactored components
   - Runs on a separate port to avoid conflicts

### API Endpoints

The implementation provides these key endpoints:

#### Collection Sharing
- `POST /api/share/collection/:collectionId/user` - Share collection with a user
- `DELETE /api/share/collection/:collectionId/user/:targetUserId` - Remove sharing
- `PATCH /api/share/collection/:collectionId/user/:targetUserId` - Update permissions
- `POST /api/share/collection/:collectionId/link` - Create a share link
- `GET /api/share/collections/shared-with-me` - Get collections shared with user
- `GET /api/share/token/:shareToken` - Access a collection via share token

#### Collection Management
- `GET /api/collections` - Get all collections for the current user
- `GET /api/collections/:collectionId` - Get a specific collection
- `GET /api/collections/:collectionId/items` - Get items in a collection

### Technical Requirements

This implementation relies on:
- Express.js for API routing
- JWT for authentication
- The existing platform-agnostic CollectionsWorkflow
- Node.js core modules for server functionality

## Next Steps
1. Implement React front-end components for web interface
   - Create collection management UI
   - Implement sharing interface with permissions controls
   - Add share link generation dialog
   - Build shared collections view

2. Enhance authentication system
   - Add user registration and management
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add OAuth integration for third-party login 

3. Improve security features
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Enhance error handling and validation

## Notes
This implementation completes the API portion of the web interface for collection sharing, bringing platform parity with the Discord and Telegram implementations. The feature follows the architecture outlined in REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, maintaining a clean separation between business logic and UI.

To preserve backward compatibility, we've created a new application entry point (app.js) rather than modifying the existing server.js file. This allows the legacy system to continue operating undisturbed while the new refactored components run alongside it. The web platform operates on a separate port (default: 4000) to avoid conflicts with the existing server.

The implementation showcases how platform-specific APIs can be built on top of platform-agnostic business logic. While the user interfaces differ between platforms (to match each platform's conventions), the underlying functionality remains consistent.

The front-end components will need to be developed separately, but the API now provides all the necessary endpoints for a web client to interact with the collection sharing functionality. This represents a significant step forward in making the StationThis bot a truly cross-platform service.
