## Next Steps

1. Enhance callback handling
   - Complete implementation of regenerate feature
   - Complete implementation of upscale feature
   - Add more interactive elements

2. Prepare for Discord adapter
   - Begin implementation of Discord commands
   - Create Discord media handling
   - Structure Discord adapter according to platform pattern

3. Prepare for Web interface adapter
   - Design Web API routes
   - Plan Web UI components
   - Structure Web adapter according to platform pattern

4. Comprehensive testing
   - Test all command handlers with various inputs
   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Test integration with services

## Blockers

No significant blockers identified at this time.

## Notes

The Telegram adapter implementation is following the clean separation pattern outlined in the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md document. All platform-specific code is isolated in the adapter, with workflows and services remaining platform-agnostic.

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing bot commands while leveraging the new architecture.

### Latest Updates

The train model command has been implemented for Telegram, allowing users to:
- Create new training datasets with the `/train create [name]` command
- Add images to datasets by replying to images with `/train add [loraId]`
- List all training datasets with the `/train list` command
- View training dataset details with the `/train view [loraId]` command
- Submit training datasets for processing with the `/train submit [loraId]` command

The implementation follows the same pattern as other commands, with clean error handling and user feedback during operations. All functionality is connected to the platform-agnostic trainModel workflow. The command provides interactive buttons for viewing and managing training datasets, following the established UI patterns.
