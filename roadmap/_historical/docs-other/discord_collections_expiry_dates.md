# Phase 4: Discord Collection Sharing Expiry Dates Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of expiry dates for collection sharing in the Discord platform adapter. This enhancement adds time-limited access to the existing sharing system by allowing users to set and manage expiry dates for share links in Discord.

| Documentation                  | Completed | Created progress and handoff documents      |

## Implementation Details

### Expiry Date Model
- Implemented a standardized expiry date model consistent with the web platform:
  - Set through a dropdown with common periods (1-90 days)
  - Stored on the backend as an ISO date string
  - Displayed to users as a formatted date with days remaining
  - Color-coded indicators when approaching expiration (orange for ≤3 days)

### Discord UI Implementation
- Enhanced the `collectionsCommand.js` with:
  - Improved modal for creating share links with standardized expiry options
  - New modal for updating expiry dates of existing share links
  - "Update Expiry" button for existing share links
  - Color-coded embeds based on expiry status
  - Formatted date display with localized date strings

### Backend Integration
- Added core workflow method:
  - `updateShareLinkExpiry()` in collections.js
- Integrated with backend API endpoints:
  - PATCH `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link/expiry` - Updates expiry date

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows the platform-agnostic approach outlined in the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, with all business logic related to expiry dates contained in shared workflows and only Discord-specific UI code in the platform adapter.

Key aspects of the implementation:
- Used Discord.js component system (modals, buttons, embeds) for the UI
- Maintained consistent expiry options with web platform (1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 90 days)
- Added validation for user inputs with sensible defaults
- Implemented visual feedback for expiry status
- Enhanced interaction handlers for new button and modal interactions

## User Flow

1. **When creating a share link**:
   - User clicks "Create Share Link" button
   - User inputs expiry period in the modal
   - System creates link with specified expiry
   - User sees embed with formatted expiry date and days remaining

2. **For viewing expiry information**:
   - User sees formatted expiry date in the share link embed
   - User sees days remaining until expiry
   - Embed color indicates expiry status (orange if ≤3 days)

3. **For updating expiry date**:
   - User clicks "Update Expiry" button
   - User inputs new expiry period in the modal
   - System updates expiry date
   - User sees confirmation embed with updated expiry information

## Next Steps

1. **Telegram Platform Integration**
   - Add expiry date functionality to Telegram commands
   - Implement expiry info and update commands in Telegram
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all platforms

2. **Expiry Notification System**
   - Create a notification mechanism for approaching expiry
   - Implement cross-platform alerts for expiring links
   - Add workflow for handling expired links

3. **Admin Management Tools**
   - Develop bulk management interfaces for administrators
   - Create reporting for expired/soon-to-expire links
   - Implement permission templating with expiry controls

## Notes

This implementation completes the expiry dates feature for Discord collection sharing, enhancing the security and flexibility of the sharing system. The UI is designed to be intuitive while working within Discord's component system.

The feature provides a more sophisticated sharing model that allows time-limited access to collections, which was one of the enhancement goals identified in the previous handoff document (HANDOFF-PHASE4-COLLECTION-EXPIRY-DATES.md).

By maintaining a consistent approach with the web platform while adapting to Discord's UI patterns, we've ensured that users have a similar experience regardless of their preferred platform.
