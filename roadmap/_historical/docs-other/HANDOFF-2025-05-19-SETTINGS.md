# HANDOFF: 2025-05-19

## Work Completed
- Implemented `UserSettingsService` (`src/core/services/userSettingsService.js`) for managing user-specific tool parameters.
    - `getEffectiveSettings(masterAccountId, toolId)`: Fetches tool defaults and user preferences, merging them.
    - `validatePreferences(toolId, preferences)`: Validates parameter names and types against the tool's `inputSchema`.
    - `savePreferences(masterAccountId, toolId, preferences)`: Saves validated preferences via an internal API call.
    - `getResolvedInput(toolId, userInput, masterAccountId)`: Combines user input, user preferences, and tool defaults with correct precedence.
- Created new internal API route `GET /internal/v1/data/tools/:toolId/input-schema` in `src/api/internal/toolDefinitionApi.js` to expose tool input schemas.
    - Implementation retrieves `tool.inputSchema` from `ToolRegistry`.
- Created new internal API route `GET /internal/v1/data/users/:masterAccountId/used-tools` in `src/api/internal/userToolsApi.js` to query tools a user has previously used.
    - Implementation queries `generationOutputs` for distinct `metadata.toolId` by `masterAccountId`.
- Mounted new API routers:
    - `toolDefinitionApiRouter` mounted at `/v1/data/tools` in `src/api/internal/index.js`. `apiDependencies` updated with `toolRegistry`.
    - `userToolsApiRouter` (using `mergeParams`) mounted at `/:masterAccountId/used-tools` within `src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js`.
- Updated `userPreferencesApi.js` (`src/api/internal/userPreferencesApi.js`):
    - The `PUT /preferences/:toolId` route now calls `UserSettingsService.validatePreferences` before saving. Returns 400 on validation failure.
    - Added a new `DELETE /preferences/:toolId` route that calls `db.userPreferences.deletePreferenceKey`.
    - `UserSettingsService` (via `getUserSettingsService`) instantiated with `toolRegistry` and `internalApiClient` dependencies.
- Verified `userPreferencesDb.js` (`src/core/services/db/userPreferencesDb.js`) already contained the necessary `deletePreferenceKey(masterAccountId, preferenceKey)` method. No changes were needed.
- Added a `TODO` placeholder comment in `src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js` within the `bot.onText` handler, outlining where `UserSettingsService.getResolvedInput(...)` should be called to integrate user preferences into command processing.

## Current State
- The core system for managing user-specific default parameters for AI generation tools, as defined in ADR-006, is implemented.
- `UserSettingsService` provides a centralized and consistent logic layer for:
    - Fetching effective settings (tool defaults + user preferences).
    - Validating user preferences against tool schemas.
    - Saving user preferences.
    - Resolving the final input parameters for a tool by merging user-provided input, user-specific preferences, and tool-defined defaults in the correct order of precedence (`userInput` > `userPreferences` > `toolDefaults`).
- Necessary internal API endpoints are now available to support these functionalities:
    - `GET /internal/v1/data/tools/:toolId/input-schema` (for fetching tool capabilities).
    - `GET /internal/v1/data/users/:masterAccountId/used-tools` (for UI features showing user history).
    - `PUT /users/:masterAccountId/preferences/:toolId` (for saving preferences, now with validation).
    - `DELETE /users/:masterAccountId/preferences/:toolId` (for resetting preferences for a tool).
    - The existing `GET /users/:masterAccountId/preferences/:toolId` can be used by `UserSettingsService` to fetch current preferences.
- The system is now prepared for platform adapters (like Telegram, Web UI) to integrate `UserSettingsService.getResolvedInput` to make user preferences effective during tool execution.
- Linter errors and minor typos encountered during the development of these components have been addressed.

## Next Tasks
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for all methods in `UserSettingsService` (`getEffectiveSettings`, `validatePreferences`, `savePreferences`, `getResolvedInput`).
    - Implement integration tests for the new internal API endpoints:
        - `GET /internal/v1/data/tools/:toolId/input-schema`
        - `GET /internal/v1/data/users/:masterAccountId/used-tools`
    - Update/add integration tests for the modified/new `userPreferencesApi` endpoints:
        - `PUT /users/:masterAccountId/preferences/:toolId` (testing validation logic).
        - `DELETE /users/:masterAccountId/preferences/:toolId`.
    - Create end-to-end tests for a complete user flow:
        1. User sets a preference for a specific tool via an (emulated) API call.
        2. User runs that tool with some input (or no input for parameters they've set a preference for).
        3. Verify that the `UserSettingsService.getResolvedInput` (or the final parameters sent to the tool service like `comfyuiService`) correctly reflects the merged user input, user preference, and tool default.
- **Platform Integration:**
    - Complete the integration in `src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js` by replacing the `TODO` comment with actual calls to `UserSettingsService.getResolvedInput(currentToolId, userInputsForTool, masterAccountId)`. Ensure `resolvedInputs` are then used to form the final payload for `comfyuiService.submitRequest` or `workflowsService.prepareToolRunPayload`.
    - Plan and implement integration of `UserSettingsService.getResolvedInput` into other platform adapters (e.g., Web UI, Discord commands) to ensure consistent behavior.
- **UI for Settings Management:**
    - Design and develop UI components for users to manage their tool preferences. This could be:
        - A `/settings` command in Telegram that allows viewing and modifying preferences for used tools.
        - A dedicated section in the Web UI.
    - These UI features will utilize the newly created/updated internal APIs.
- **Monitoring and Error Handling:**
    - Review logging within `UserSettingsService` and related API routes for clarity and completeness.
    - Ensure robust error handling and appropriate user feedback, especially for preference validation failures.
- **Documentation:**
    - Update any relevant developer documentation regarding user settings and the new APIs.

## Changes to Plan
- No major deviations from the architecture outlined in ADR-006.
- Minor implementation detail: `userToolsApi.js` was refactored to use `express.Router({ mergeParams: true })` to inherit `masterAccountId` from its parent router (`userCoreApi.js`), simplifying its route definitions.

## Open Questions
- What are the priority platform adapters (after Telegram) for full integration of `UserSettingsService.getResolvedInput`?
- What specific complex scenarios or edge cases should be prioritized for end-to-end testing (e.g., empty preferences, invalid preference types, interaction with required vs. optional parameters)?
- Are there existing test scripts (like `scripts/test_internal_api.sh`) or frameworks that should be extended for testing these new features, or should new test suites be created?
- How should the user-facing settings UI (e.g., Telegram `/settings` command) behave? What information should it display, and how should users interact with it to change settings for different tools and parameters?
