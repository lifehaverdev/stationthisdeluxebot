# ComfyUI Deploy

ComfyUI Deploy is an open-source deployment platform for ComfyUI workflows, functioning like "Vercel for generative workflow infrastructure." It provides serverless hosted GPU with vertical integration with ComfyUI, allowing users to deploy, version, and manage complex ComfyUI workflows through a centralized dashboard. The platform supports both long-running on-premise ComfyUI machines and serverless options, with integration for RunPods, Modal, and hosted ComfyDeploy machines.
