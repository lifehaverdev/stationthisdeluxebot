# HANDOFF: 2023-12-15 ComfyUI Deploy Integration

## Work Completed

I've implemented the initial phase of the ComfyUI Deploy integration initiative, which makes the ComfyUI Deploy API the authoritative source of truth for StationThis. The following components have been refactored:

1. **Core Services:**
   - Updated `src/core/services/comfyui.js` to directly use ComfyUI Deploy API endpoints for all operations
   - Enhanced `src/core/services/workflows.js` to eliminate database dependencies and use ComfyUI Deploy API exclusively
   - Added proper caching mechanisms with configurable TTL values to optimize performance

2. **Documentation:**
   - Created ADR-003 documenting the architectural decision to use ComfyUI Deploy API as the source of truth
   - Documented the API endpoints being used and implementation strategy

## Current State

The core service layer has been refactored to use ComfyUI Deploy API as the primary data source. Key changes include:

- All workflow listing is now derived directly from the ComfyUI Deploy API
- Workflow execution uses direct API calls to ComfyUI Deploy
- Internal caching is used for performance optimization with configurable TTL
- Database dependencies have been removed from the core services

The implementation follows the principles outlined in the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md:
- **Practical over Perfect**: Focused on a working integration
- **Feature-First**: Maintained all existing functionality
- **Incremental Migration**: Core services refactored first, platform adapters to follow

## Next Tasks

The following tasks should be prioritized next:

1. **Update Workflow Files:**
   - Refactor `src/workflows/*.js` files to use the updated core services
   - Ensure they're properly using the new API-driven approach

2. **Platform Adapters:**
   - Update Telegram platform adapter to use the refactored core services
   - Adjust Discord and Web adapters if already implemented

3. **Testing:**
   - Verify all workflow operations work with the new API-driven approach
   - Load test with realistic traffic to ensure caching strategies are effective

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement monitoring for API performance and availability
   - Add logging for cache hit/miss statistics

5. **Clean Up:**
   - Remove any remaining direct database queries for workflow information
   - Migrate any remaining components that still use the legacy approach

## Changes to Plan

This implementation aligns with the original REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN but emphasizes an even stronger decoupling from the database than originally described. The database is now only to be used for user-specific data (points, preferences) but not for workflow information.

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting:** What are the rate limits for the ComfyUI Deploy API? We should document these and ensure our implementation respects them.

2. **Error Handling:** How should we handle API unavailability? Currently, we're falling back to cached data when available, but we may need a more comprehensive strategy.

3. **Authentication:** Are we using API keys appropriately, or should we implement a more sophisticated authentication mechanism?

4. **Webhook Integration:** Should we leverage webhooks for real-time updates rather than polling for workflow status?
