# Execution Cost Tracking Feature

## Purpose
Display the total execution cost of all tools run in the current workspace, updating as executions complete.

## Step 1: Codebase Audit

- [ ] List all files and functions related to tool execution, cost reporting, and workspace state.
- [ ] Document current state of cost tracking (if any).
- [ ] Identify any blockers or architectural constraints.

## Step 2: Design

- [ ] Define data structures for tracking execution cost per node and workspace total.
- [ ] UI/UX sketches for cost display and updates.
- [ ] Error handling (missing cost data, partial executions).

## Step 3: Implementation

- [ ] Update tool execution logic to record/report cost.
- [ ] Update workspace state and UI to display total cost.
- [ ] Update on execution completion or error.

## Step 4: Demo & Handoff

- [ ] Create a Playwright or screen recording demo.
- [ ] Update master plan and handoff doc.
