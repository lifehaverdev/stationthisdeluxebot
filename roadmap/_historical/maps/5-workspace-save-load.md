# Workspace Save/Load Feature

## Purpose
Allow users to save the entire workspace (nodes, connections, parameters, state) and reload it later, supporting persistence and session recovery.

## Step 1: Codebase Audit

- [ ] List all files and functions related to workspace state, serialization, and persistence.
- [ ] Document current state of save/load logic (if any).
- [ ] Identify any blockers or architectural constraints.

## Step 2: Design

- [ ] Define data structures for workspace serialization.
- [ ] UI/UX sketches for save/load actions and recovery prompts.
- [ ] Error handling (corrupt data, versioning).

## Step 3: Implementation

- [ ] Implement serialization and deserialization of workspace state.
- [ ] Implement save/load UI and backend/localStorage integration.
- [ ] Auto-save and recovery logic.

## Step 4: Demo & Handoff

- [ ] Create a Playwright or screen recording demo.
- [ ] Update master plan and handoff doc.
