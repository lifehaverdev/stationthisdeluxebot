# HANDOFF: 2025-07-14

## Work Completed
- Implemented Spells Menu Manager modal for the web sandbox platform.
- Connected frontend to backend via external and internal API layers.
- Displayed user's spells and public marketplace spells in the modal.
- Added spell detail view: users can view, edit (name/description), and delete their spells.
- Enforced unique spell names per user in the UI.
- Added robust error handling and user feedback for spell editing.
- Added logging to internal and external APIs for debugging data flow.

## Current State
- User can view their spells and public spells in the web UI.
- Spell detail view allows editing name/description and deleting spells (UI).
- Backend returns correct spell data for the user.
- **Outstanding bug:** Saving (PUT) a spell from the web UI fails with a 401/502 error due to missing `ownedBy` in the payload sent from the external API to the internal API.

## Next Tasks
- Fix the external API to always include `ownedBy: user.userId` in the PUT payload for spell updates.
- Complete step editing (add, remove, reorder steps) in the spell detail view.
- Implement spell creation flow from the web UI.
- Add "import from marketplace" functionality.
- Continue UI/UX polish and error handling improvements.

## Changes to Plan
- None; work is proceeding according to the ADR and collaboration protocol.

## Open Questions
- Should spell name uniqueness be enforced globally or per user?
- Any additional metadata or permissions needed for spells in the web UI? 

## Web Spell Step Editor Implementation Plan (2025-07-14)

### Overview
We are designing a flexible, user-friendly spell step editor for the web platform, leveraging the full capabilities of the backend workflow engine. This will allow users to build complex, multi-step workflows (spells) by chaining together tools, mapping parameters, and defining custom spell inputs/outputs.

### Design Considerations
- **Step Management:** Add, remove, reorder steps. Each step selects a tool and configures its parameters.
- **Parameter Mapping:** For each step parameter, allow static values, mapping from spell input, or mapping from previous step output.
- **Spell Inputs/Outputs:** Users can define which parameters are exposed as spell-level inputs (e.g., "prompt", "image").
- **Output Mapping:** Allow mapping outputs from steps to later step inputs or to the final spell output.

### Proposed UI/UX Flow
1. **Spell Detail View:**
   - List of steps (sortable, add/remove).
   - "Add Step" button (tool picker).
   - Each step shows tool name, parameters, and output mappings.
2. **Step Editor:**
   - Tool selection.
   - Parameter editor: static value, map from spell input, or map from previous step output.
   - Output mapping editor (optional/advanced).
3. **Spell Inputs Editor:**
   - List of spell-level inputs.
   - Add/remove/edit spell inputs.
   - Show where each input is used in the workflow.
4. **Preview/Validation:**
   - Show a summary of the workflow: required inputs, outputs, and data flow between steps.

### Implementation Plan (MVP)
- Step 1: Add UI to add/remove/reorder steps in the spell.
- Step 2: For each step, allow tool selection and parameter editing.
- Step 3: For each parameter, allow mapping from spell input or previous step output.
- Step 4: Allow user to define spell-level inputs.
- Step 5: (Advanced) Visualize data flow and output mapping.

### Technical Notes
- Backend supports `parameterOverrides` and `outputMappings` per step.
- Web UI will fetch the tool registry and maintain a local model of the spell being edited.
- Saving will send the full spell object (steps, parameterOverrides, outputMappings) to the backend.

## Architectural Decision: Node-Based Sandbox for Spell Creation (2025-07-14)

### Decision
- The node-based sandbox will be the primary interface for creating and editing spells.
- Users will visually connect tools (nodes), set up data flows, and build complex workflows in the sandbox.
- Spells are defined as subgraphs (selected groups of connected nodes) that can be "minted" (saved) as reusable workflows.
- The spell menu/modal will be used for managing, launching, and editing spell metadata, but not for visual construction.

### Rationale
- Node editors are the industry standard for visual workflow design, supporting parallelism, branching, and complex data flows.
- This approach enables intuitive, powerful, and future-proof spell creation.
- Users can build, test, and mint spells directly from their sandbox workspace.

### Next Steps
- Audit and improve the current sandbox design to fully support:
  - Node creation (adding tool nodes)
  - Node connection (defining data flow and dependencies)
  - Node parameter editing
  - Selection of subgraphs for "minting" as spells
  - Save/load workflows as spells
  - Visual cues for parallelism and data flow
  - "Mint as Spell" action for selected nodes
- The spell menu/modal will be updated to allow opening spells in the sandbox for editing.
