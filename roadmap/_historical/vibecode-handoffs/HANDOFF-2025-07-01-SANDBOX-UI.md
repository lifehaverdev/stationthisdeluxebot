# HANDOFF: 2025-07-01 - Sandbox UI Refactoring

## Work Completed
- Created new modular structure for sandbox UI components:
  - Separated concerns into individual modules (io.js, state.js, canvas.js, toolSelection.js)
  - Created dedicated components directory for reusable UI elements
  - Implemented proper state management through state.js
- Fixed critical API endpoint issues:
  - Resolved route conflict between `/tools/registry` and `/tools/:toolId`
  - Improved error handling in tools API to provide better debugging information
  - Added proper CORS configuration to support both development ports (3000 and 4000)
- Successfully retrieved and displayed tools from the registry in the UI

## Current State
- The sandbox UI is now loading tools from the registry endpoint
- Tools are being displayed in the creation modal when clicking image/sound/text/movie buttons
- Basic UI interactions (modal showing/hiding, tool selection) are working
- Legacy sandbox.js is kept for comparison while we complete the refactor

### Working Features
- Tool registry integration
- Modal UI for tool selection
- Category-based tool filtering
- Error handling and user feedback

### Known Issues
- All tools are currently showing in every category (needs filtering implementation)
- Legacy code still present in sandbox.js (pending removal after refactor completion)

## Next Tasks
1. Implement proper tool category filtering
2. Add tool window creation and management
3. Implement connection system between tools
4. Add drag-and-drop functionality
5. Remove legacy sandbox.js code once feature parity is achieved

## Changes to Plan
No significant deviations from the refactor plan. The modular approach aligns with the architectural goals outlined in REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md.

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement stricter category filtering, or allow tools to appear in multiple categories if they match multiple criteria?
2. Do we want to maintain backward compatibility with any aspects of the legacy sandbox implementation?
3. Should we consider adding a configuration file for category definitions and tool type mappings?

## Addendum: 2025-07-02 - Core Interaction Fixes

### Work Completed
- **Fixed Sidebar Tool Loading:** The sidebar now correctly fetches and displays all available tools from the `/api/v1/tools/registry` endpoint, grouped by category.
- **Implemented Tool Window Dragging:** Tool windows are now properly draggable by their headers, allowing them to be repositioned on the canvas.
- **Implemented Drag-to-Connect Functionality:**
  - Dragging from a tool's output anchor creates a visible, temporary line that follows the cursor.
  - Dropping the line on a compatible input anchor on another tool creates a persistent, visible connection.
  - Dropping the line on an empty canvas space opens a modal showing only tools compatible with the output type.
  - Selecting a tool from the connection modal creates the new tool window and a persistent line connecting it to the source tool.
- **Refactored State Management & Bug Fixes:**
  - Resolved multiple `ReferenceError` and race condition bugs that were breaking the connection workflow.
  - Centralized connection logic into `connections.js` and state accessors into `state.js` for improved code structure and maintainability.

### Current State
- The core sandbox UI is now functional and stable. The primary features outlined as "Next Tasks" in the original handoff (tool window management, connection system, and drag-and-drop) are now implemented in the new modular system. The legacy `sandbox.js` is now fully superseded in functionality.

### Next Tasks
1. Remove legacy `sandbox.js` file and any references to it.
2. Implement the tool execution logic (clicking the "Execute" button on a tool window).
3. Design and implement the UI for displaying tool outputs (images, text, etc.).
4. Add functionality for the "upload" button in the action modal.
5. Address the open questions from the original handoff regarding category filtering and configuration.
