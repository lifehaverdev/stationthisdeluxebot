# HANDOFF: 2025-07-03

## Work Completed
- Centralized all tool execution logic (ComfyUI, OpenAI, static tools) behind a single internal endpoint: `/internal/v1/data/execute`.
- Refactored dynamic Telegram commands to use the new endpoint, supporting both webhook (async) and immediate (sync) tool delivery.
- Updated tool definitions and registry to include a `deliveryMode` property (`'immediate'` or `'webhook'`), standardizing delivery expectations.
- Refactored `WorkflowExecutionService` and `SpellsService` to use the centralized execution endpoint for all spell/workflow steps.
- Refactored `tweakManager.js` to use the centralized endpoint for all tweak executions.
- Validated that all flows (dynamic commands, spells, tweaks) now work for both ComfyUI and static tools (e.g., ChatGPT).

## Current State
- All tool executions (dynamic commands, spells, tweaks) are routed through the centralized endpoint.
- Tool delivery is now standardized and determined by the `deliveryMode` property in the tool definition.
- No direct calls to ComfyUI or OpenAI remain in platform or workflow code; all business logic is centralized.
- The system is ready for further extension (new tool types, new delivery modes) with minimal changes.

## Next Tasks
- Test and validate spell execution with mixed tool types (immediate and webhook).
- Refactor any remaining custom tool runners or legacy flows to use the centralized endpoint.
- Continue to improve error handling, logging, and user feedback for all execution flows.
- Document the new execution contract and update developer onboarding materials.

## Changes to Plan
- No major deviations from the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md. The modular, centralized approach aligns with the North Star architecture.

## Open Questions
- Should we add more delivery modes (e.g., streaming, batch) to the tool definition?
- How should we handle partial failures in multi-step spells with mixed delivery modes?
- What additional metrics or audit trails should be added to monitor tool usage and costing?
