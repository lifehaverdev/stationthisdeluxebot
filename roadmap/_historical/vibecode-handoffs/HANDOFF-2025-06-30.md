  - Added environment variable check for `ALCHEMY_SIGNING_KEY`
  - Implemented timing-safe signature comparison to prevent attacks
  - Added comprehensive error handling that maintains Alchemy webhook stability

- **Updated Web Routes**:
  - Modified `/api/webhook/alchemy` endpoint to use new security middleware
  - Maintained existing success/error handling and logging patterns
  - Added startup validation for required environment variables

- **Documentation**:
  - Created detailed README in `src/core/services/alchemy/README.md`
  - Added sequence diagrams for webhook flow
  - Documented testing procedures and security measures
  - Provided curl examples for endpoint verification

- **Implemented withdrawal functionality in the credit vault system**:
  - Added `initiateWithdrawal` method to CreditService for user-triggered withdrawals
  - Added withdrawal event handling to unified webhook processor
  - Added `processWithdrawalRequest` for executing withdrawals
  - Extended CreditLedgerDB with withdrawal tracking capabilities

- **Refactored webhook handling**:
  - Created unified `handleEventWebhook` method to process all event types
  - Extracted event-specific processing into `_processDepositEvent` and `_processWithdrawalEvent`
  - Simplified webhook route to use single entry point
  - Maintained robust validation and security checks

## Current State

The Alchemy webhook endpoint is now properly secured with the following features:
- HMAC SHA-256 signature verification
- Timing attack prevention
- Proper error status codes (401 for auth failures)
- Maintained 200 OK responses for Alchemy stability
- Environment variable configuration

### Event Processing Architecture
1. **Unified Webhook Handler**
   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/webhook/alchemy', 
     validateAlchemySignature(alchemySigningKey),
     async (req, res) => {
       const result = await creditService.handleEventWebhook(req.body);
       res.json(result);
     }
   );
   ```

2. **Event Type Processing**
   - Event fragments loaded at start:
     ```javascript
     const depositEventFragment = getEventFragment('DepositRecorded');
     const withdrawalEventFragment = getEventFragment('WithdrawalRequested');
     ```
   - Event routing based on topic hash:
     ```javascript
     if (topics[0] === depositEventHash) {
       await this._processDepositEvent(decodedLog, ...);
     } else if (topics[0] === withdrawalEventHash) {
       await this._processWithdrawalEvent(decodedLog, ...);
     }
     ```

### Adding New Event Types
To add support for new contract events:

1. **Contract Event Definition**
   - Add event to contract ABI
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     event NewEventType(
       address indexed user,
       uint256 value,
       bytes metadata
     );
     ```

2. **Event Handler Implementation**
   - Add event fragment to `handleEventWebhook`:
     ```javascript
     const newEventFragment = getEventFragment('NewEventType');
     const newEventHash = getEventTopic(newEventFragment);
     ```
   - Create processing method:
     ```javascript
     async _processNewEvent(decodedLog, txHash, blockNumber) {
       // 1. Extract event data
       const { user, value, metadata } = decodedLog;
       
       // 2. Add DB schema/table if needed
       
       // 3. Implement processing logic
       
       // 4. Update state/trigger actions
     }
     ```
   - Add to event routing:
     ```javascript
     else if (topics[0] === newEventHash) {
       await this._processNewEvent(decodedLog, ...);
     }
     ```

3. **Database Extensions**
   - Add new tables/collections if needed
   - Add methods to track event state
   - Follow existing patterns in CreditLedgerDB

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for new event processing
   - Add integration tests for full flow
   - Test error handling and edge cases

### Withdrawal Flow
1. **User-Initiated Withdrawal**
   - User requests withdrawal through UI/Telegram
   - `initiateWithdrawal` creates on-chain withdrawal request
   - Request is tracked in DB with status `PENDING_PROCESSING`

2. **Event Processing**
   - Alchemy webhook detects `WithdrawalRequested` events
   - `handleWithdrawalRequestWebhook` processes these events
   - Events are processed in parallel with deposits

3. **Withdrawal Execution**
   - System verifies user account and collateral
   - Calculates withdrawal amount and fees
   - Executes `withdrawTo` function via EthereumService
   - Updates ledger with final status

### Database Schema Updates
- New withdrawal request tracking in CreditLedgerDB
- Status tracking: PENDING_PROCESSING → COMPLETED/ERROR/REJECTED
- Full transaction history with fees and amounts

### Security & Validation
- Maintains existing signature validation for Alchemy webhooks
- Preserves all deposit functionality
- Includes profitability checks for withdrawal transactions

The system is ready for webhook testing and deployment.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor withdrawal processing for any issues
2. Consider adding event processing metrics/monitoring
3. Add support for additional events:
   - `LiquidationEvent`
   - `VaultAccountCreated`
   - `CreditConfirmed`

## Open Questions
1. Should we add retry logic for failed event processing?
2. Do we need to implement event prioritization?
3. Should we add batch processing for certain event types?

## Technical Details

### Event Processing Flow
1. Webhook received → signature validated
2. Events decoded and routed by type
3. Each event processed by specialized handler
4. State updates and follow-up actions triggered
5. Results aggregated and returned

### Error Handling
- Individual event failures don't block other events
- Each event type has specific error states
- All errors logged with context for debugging

### Monitoring Considerations
- Track event processing latency
- Monitor event queue sizes
- Alert on processing failures
- Track gas costs for on-chain actions

## Demonstration Steps
1. Deposit ETH to trigger DepositRecorded event
2. Request withdrawal to trigger WithdrawalRequested
3. Check logs for unified processing
4. Verify database entries for both events

## Notes
- The unified handler makes it easier to maintain consistency across event types
- Each event type can have its own processing logic while sharing common infrastructure
- New event types can be added without changing the webhook route
- Consider implementing event replay capability for recovery scenarios

## Changes to Plan
No deviations from REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md. This security implementation aligns with the existing architecture and maintains proper service boundaries.

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement rate limiting on the webhook endpoint?
2. Do we need to add IP allowlisting in addition to signature verification?
3. Should we add a webhook request/response logging system for debugging?
4. What metrics should we track for webhook reliability?
5. Should we implement a withdrawal cooldown period?
6. Do we need additional monitoring for large withdrawals?
7. Should we add a withdrawal queue for high-load scenarios?

## Technical Details

### Key Methods Added
```typescript
// CreditService
initiateWithdrawal(userAddress, tokenAddress, vaultAccount?)
handleWithdrawalRequestWebhook(webhookPayload)
processWithdrawalRequest(requestTxHash)

// CreditLedgerDB
createWithdrawalRequest(requestDetails)
updateWithdrawalRequestStatus(txHash, status, details)
findWithdrawalRequestByTxHash(txHash)
```

### Event Flow
1. User calls `initiateWithdrawal`
2. Smart contract emits `WithdrawalRequested`
3. Alchemy webhook triggers `handleWithdrawalRequestWebhook`
4. System processes request via `processWithdrawalRequest`
5. Smart contract executes `withdrawTo`
6. DB updated with final status

### Error Handling
- Unprofitable withdrawals are rejected
- Failed transactions are marked for retry
- System maintains audit trail of all attempts

## Demonstration
To test the withdrawal functionality:
1. Use Telegram or Web UI to initiate withdrawal
2. Monitor webhook endpoint for event processing
3. Check DB for status updates
4. Verify on-chain transaction completion

The implementation is ready for testing in the staging environment.
