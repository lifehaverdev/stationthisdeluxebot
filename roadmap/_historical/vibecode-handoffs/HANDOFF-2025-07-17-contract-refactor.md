# HANDOFF: 2025-07-17

## Work Completed
- **Systematic Refactor of All Smart Contract Interactions:**
  - **`creditService.js`:** Fully refactored to use new `foundation` and `charteredFund` ABIs, function names (`commit`, `remit`, `charterFund`, etc.), and event handlers (`ContributionRecorded`, `RescissionRequested`, `FundChartered`). Updated all internal logic to match new contract semantics.
  - **`src/core/contracts/index.js`:** Replaced `creditVault` and `creditVaultAccount` with `foundation` and `charteredFund`, ensuring the new ABIs are the single source of truth.
  - **`src/core/services/index.js`:** Updated the service initializer to correctly configure and inject the `CreditService` with the new `foundation` contract details.
  - **`saltMiningService.js` & `saltMiningWorker.js`:** Refactored the `CREATE2` logic to use the `foundation` contract as the factory and the `charteredFund` bytecode for address prediction.
  - **`src/api/internal/pointsApi.js`:** Updated to use the `foundationAbi` for encoding user-facing point purchase transactions.
- **Initial Codebase Audit:** Performed a full codebase search to identify all affected files and documented them in this handoff.
- **Verification:** Ran final checks to ensure no legacy function names (`confirmCredit`, `createVaultAccount`) remain in the backend codebase.

## Current State
- The backend codebase is now fully aligned with the new `foundation.s` and `charteredFund.s` smart contracts.
- All identified contract interactions have been updated.
- The system is now ready for comprehensive integration testing to validate the changes against a deployed version of the new contracts.

### 1. ABI Imports and Contract Config
- **[DONE]** `src/core/contracts/index.js`: Imports `creditVaultAbi`, `creditVaultAccountAbi` (to be replaced with `foundation.json`, `charteredFund.json`).
- **[DONE]** `src/core/services/alchemy/creditService.js`: Uses `creditVaultAbi`, `creditVaultAddress` in config and throughout service.
- **[DONE]** `src/core/services/alchemy/saltMiningService.js`: Loads `creditVaultAccount.bytecode.json` and references `creditVaultAddress`.
- **[DONE]** `src/core/services/alchemy/saltMiningWorker.js`: Uses `creditVaultAddress` and `VaultAccount` bytecode.

### 2. Function Calls (Old → New)
- **[DONE]** `createVaultAccount` → `charterFund`
- **[DONE]** `computeVaultAccountAddress` → `computeCharterAddress`
- **[DONE]** `confirmCredit` → `commit`
- **[DONE]** `deposit`/`depositFor` → `contribute`/`contributeFor`
- **[DONE]** `withdrawTo` → `remit`
- **[DONE]** `withdraw` → `requestRescission`
- **[DONE]** `recordWithdrawalRequest` → `recordRescissionRequest`
- **[DONE]** `recordWithdrawal` → `recordRemittance`
- **[DONE]** `blessEscrow` → `allocate`

### 3. Event Handling (Old → New)
- **[DONE]** `DepositRecorded` → `ContributionRecorded`
- **[DONE]** `CreditConfirmed` → `CommitmentConfirmed`
- **[DONE]** `VaultAccountCreated` → `FundChartered`
- **[DONE]** `WithdrawalRequested` → `RescissionRequested`
- **[DONE]** `WithdrawalProcessed` → `RemittanceProcessed`
- **[DONE]** `UserWithdrawal` → `ContributionRescinded`

#### Example Affected Code (partial, see full search results for more):
- **[DONE]** `src/core/services/alchemy/creditService.js`: Handles and decodes events, calls contract functions, references `vaultAccount`.
- **[DONE]** `src/core/services/alchemy/saltMiningService.js`/`saltMiningWorker.js`: Handles vault account creation logic.
- **[DONE]** `src/core/services/db/alchemy/creditLedgerDb.js`, `src/api/internal/creditLedgerApi.js`: Handles withdrawal request logic (DB/API layer, may reference old event/function names).

## Next Tasks
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Deploy the new `foundation` and `charteredFund` contracts to a testnet.
  - Configure the application with the new contract addresses and test all user flows:
    - Point purchases (deposits/contributions).
    - Withdrawals (rescissions).
    - Referral vault creation (chartering funds).
- **Frontend Audit:** Double-check any frontend components that might be constructing transactions to ensure they are using the correct ABI and function names.
- **Documentation:** Update any developer documentation that references the old contract architecture.

## Changes to Plan
- None. All work proceeded according to the refactor plan and AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md.

## Open Questions
- Are there any frontend or workflow scripts that directly interact with the contracts and need to be included in this refactor?
- Are there any additional event types or contract functions not covered in the mapping table that should be updated?
