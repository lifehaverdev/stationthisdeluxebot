# HANDOFF: 2025-07-01

## Work Completed

- **Implemented Referral Vault Creation**:
  - Created `SaltMiningService` to find `CREATE2` salts for vanity addresses beginning with `0x1152...`.
  - The service uses worker threads for non-blocking salt mining and includes a pre-mined salt cache.
  - Added a `createReferralVault` method to `CreditService` to manage the vault creation lifecycle.

- **Integrated Services with Internal API**:
  - Developed `creditLedgerApi.js` to serve as the single gateway for all credit ledger database operations, enforcing proper service boundaries.
  - Refactored `CreditService` to exclusively use the `internalApiClient` for all database interactions, removing direct `creditLedgerDb` access.
  - Corrected dependency injection issues to ensure all services initialize correctly at startup.

- **Database and API Enhancements**:
  - Extended the `creditLedgerDb` schema to store and track referral vaults, linking them to a `master_account_id`.
  - Added API endpoints for creating and querying referral vaults by user account or vault address.

## Current State

- The system can successfully create referral-enabled vault contracts with deterministic, vanity-prefixed addresses (`0x1152...`).
- The entire vault creation flow is orchestrated by `CreditService` and respects our architectural principle of isolating services from direct database access.
- The application now starts up without the previous dependency injection errors.

## Next Tasks

- Implement the referral reward logic for deposits made into these new vault accounts.
- Expose the `createReferralVault` functionality through a user-facing interface (e.g., external API endpoint or Telegram command).
- Develop tests for the `SaltMiningService`, `creditLedgerApi`, and the updated `CreditService` functionality.

## Changes to Plan

- No deviations from the core plan. The implementation adheres to the architectural guidelines of using an internal API for data access.

## Open Questions

1. What is the referral reward percentage for deposits into these vaults?
2. How should the `createReferralVault` function be exposed to users (e.g., a new API endpoint, a Telegram command)?
3. Should we implement rate limiting or a cooldown period for vault creation attempts to prevent resource abuse?
