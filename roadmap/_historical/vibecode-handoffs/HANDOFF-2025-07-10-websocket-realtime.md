# HANDOFF: 2025-07-10

## Work Completed
- Refactored authentication for generation execution to use JWT throughout (removed legacy session checks)
- Fixed dualAuth middleware to support JWT and API key
- Fixed handler to accept both userId and masterAccountId for user context
- Corrected internal API proxy path for generation execution
- Implemented real-time WebSocket delivery of generation progress and results:
  - Ensured webhookProcessor receives websocketServer and emits updates
  - Updated frontend WebSocket client to listen for progress and result events
  - Mapped generationId to tool window in sandbox UI
  - Displayed progress and final result in the correct tool window
  - Rendered output images directly in the UI when available
- Validated end-to-end flow with live test and console logs

## Current State
- Sandbox UI now shows real-time progress and result updates for generation jobs
- Output images are displayed inline in the tool window upon completion
- WebSocket infrastructure is fully integrated and working
- All backend and frontend code paths are aligned on JWT-based authentication

## Next Tasks
- Enhance UI to support multiple images, download links, or richer result formatting
- Add error handling and user feedback for payment failures (e.g., insufficient points)
- Consider Playwright or equivalent test for full real-time flow
- Clean up any remaining legacy session code

## Changes to Plan
- No major deviations; all changes align with the refactor north star and real-time UX goals

## Open Questions
- Should we support other output types (text, audio, etc.) in the same UI pattern?
- Should we add notifications or toasts for generation completion?
- Is there a need for a persistent generation history panel in the sandbox?
