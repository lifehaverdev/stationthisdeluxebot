# ADR-015: Sandbox Window Overhaul

_Migrated from `roadmap/_historical/vibecode-adrs/ADR-015-sandbox-window-overhaul.md` for active reference during the live refactor (2025-08-22)._  
_No technical changes; original decision text preserved._

> _The remainder is an exact copy of the historical ADR so contributors don‚Äôt have to jump folders while working._

## Context
The web-sandbox currently has four separate window modules (`toolWindow.js`, `spellWindow.js`, `CollectionTestWindow.js`, and `CollectionReviewWindow.js`).
Each copies large blocks of code to manage:

* DOM container creation & positioning
* Header rendering (title, drag, close)
* Parameter / form sections and "show more" toggles
* Execute / progress indicator logic
* Result rendering via `renderResultContent`

This duplication has led to 700 + line files that are error-prone, hard to test, and slow to extend.

Constraints:
* Vanilla ES Modules (no React / TS)
* Vanilla CSS
* No Jest requirement

## Decision
Extract a small window framework and migrate all windows onto it.

### Core Abstractions
1. **BaseWindow** ‚Äì common shell
2. **ToolWindow** ‚Äì parameters, execution, versioning
3. **SpellWindow** ‚Äì tool window + spell-specific panels / execution
4. **Collection windows** ‚Äì specialised subclasses

### Shared Utilities
`drag.js`, `domHelpers.js`, `inputs.js`, `state.js` (persistence + undo/redo)

### Roadmap (updated)
| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Base utilities & BaseWindow | ‚úÖ Done |
| 2. Refactor ToolWindow | ‚úÖ Done |
| 3. Version selector & persistence | ‚úÖ Done |
