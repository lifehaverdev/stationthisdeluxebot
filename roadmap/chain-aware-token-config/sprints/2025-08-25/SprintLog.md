# Sprint Log 2025-08-25

## Goals
- Refactor token/NFT configuration to be chain-aware (support Mainnet & Sepolia)
- Protect users by filtering assets per connected chain
- Add network-switch prompt in Buy Points modal
- Ensure modal shows only valid assets (no undefined placeholders)
- Update backend `/supported-assets`, `/quote`, `/purchase` endpoints to consume new config

## Progress Notes
- **Day 1:**
  - Created `roadmap/chain-aware-token-config/outline.md` outlining the problem, vision & milestones.
  - Added multi-chain structure to `src/core/services/alchemy/tokenConfig.js`.
  - Introduced helpers `getChainTokenConfig`, `getChainNftConfig`, etc.
  - Added Sepolia ETH entry (zero-address).
- **Day 2:**
  - Updated backend internal `pointsApi` to return chain-filtered assets.
  - Added fallback icon logic and NFT filtering.
  - Implemented chain detection & wallet switch in `BuyPointsModal`.
  - Added asset filtering + ‚ÄúOther‚Äù tier handling in the modal.
- **Day 3:**
  - Discovered malformed payload (`tokens=[{},{}]`, `nfts=[{address:'1'}, ‚Ä¶]`).
  - Root cause: external `pointsApi` proxy did not forward `chainId` & wrong internal path.
  - Fixed route in `src/api/external/economy/pointsApi.js`.
  - Added debug logs (to be removed later) to confirm correct payload.
  - Added cache-buster and strict asset validation in modal.
- **Day 4:**
  - Found public fallback route in `src/api/external/index.js` that returned chain-agnostic placeholders.
  - Rewrote route to use `getChainTokenConfig/getChainNftConfig` helpers; added detailed previews.
  - Buy Points modal now shows correct ETH-only asset list on Sepolia. üéâ

## Demo Links
- Open Buy Points modal on Sepolia: shows single ETH entry, no NFT section.<br>
  `/src/platforms/web/client/src/sandbox/components/BuyPointsModal/buyPointsModal.js`
- Updated token config: `/src/core/services/alchemy/tokenConfig.js`
- Backend logic: `/src/api/internal/economy/pointsApi.js`

## Retrospective
**What went well**
- Rapid refactor of shared config with minimal breakage to existing callers.
- Incremental logging helped isolate cross-API mismatch quickly.

**Improvements**
- Need automated tests for asset payload shape per chain.
- Introduce e2e test that mounts modal in Sepolia mode.
- Clean up debug logs & placeholder icons before merging to main.
