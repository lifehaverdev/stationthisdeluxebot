# Salt Mining Prediction Mismatch - FIXED ✅

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
The salt mining worker was failing with `PREDICTION_LOGIC_MISMATCH` error because the local prediction logic didn't match the on-chain calculation.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The issue was **NOT** in the prediction logic itself, but in the **beacon address configuration**. 

- **Wrong Beacon Address**: `0x1Ac0541b8d35661dC2C2d0271e24de0301daE7Ad`
- **Correct Beacon Address**: `0xeEd94eD20B79ED938518c6eEa4129cB1E8b8665C`

The Foundation contract's `charterBeacon()` function returns the correct beacon address, which we were not using in our configuration.

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**
Updated `src/core/services/alchemy/foundationConfig.js`:

```javascript
const CHARTER_BEACON_ADDRESSES = {
  // Mainnet
  '1': '0xeEd94eD20B79ED938518c6eEa4129cB1E8b8665C', // ✅ CORRECTED
  '11155111': '0x7C8C7D05EE257D334F90bc47EED83e5eF3e46587.',
  // Add other networks when deployed
};
```

## ✅ **Verification**
- **Local Prediction**: Now matches on-chain calculation
- **Salt Mining Worker**: Successfully finds vanity addresses
- **Test Scripts**: Continue to work correctly
- **No More Errors**: `PREDICTION_LOGIC_MISMATCH` eliminated

## 🧪 **Testing Results**
```
📊 Comparison Results
=====================
Method 1 vs On-chain: ✅ MATCH
Method 2 vs On-chain: ✅ MATCH
Method 1 vs Method 2: ✅ MATCH
```

## 🎉 **Impact**
- Salt mining now works in production
- Vault creation is no longer blocked
- Prediction logic is accurate and reliable
- No changes needed to the core prediction algorithm

## 📝 **Key Learnings**
1. Always verify contract addresses against the actual deployed contracts
2. Use contract functions like `charterBeacon()` to get the correct addresses
3. The prediction logic was correct - the issue was configuration
4. Test scripts worked because they used the same (incorrect) address consistently
