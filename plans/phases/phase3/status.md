## Phase 3: Workflow and Interaction Refactoring ‚Äî Status Tracker

### Overview
This document tracks progress through Phase 3 of the system refactor. After completing the core state management and data access systems in Phase 2, our focus now shifts to refactoring multi-step interactions into a platform-agnostic workflow system and ensuring commands can be executed across different platforms (Telegram, web interface, etc.).

### Goals
- Create a platform-agnostic command processing framework
- Implement a workflow system for multi-step interactions
- Extract UI rendering from business logic
- Implement proper validation for all user inputs
- Continue migrating high-value commands to the new architecture

### Progress Details

#### Platform-Agnostic Command Implementation

The initial command implementation demonstrates the pattern for creating platform-agnostic commands with the following features:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Core business logic in the command handler
   - Platform-specific adapters in separate integration layers
   - Feature flags for controlled rollout

2. **Event-Based Architecture**
   - Commands emit events for monitoring and metrics
   - Lifecycle hooks for pre/post command processing
   - Support for async command execution

3. **Consistent Error Handling**
   - Standardized error reporting
   - Proper error boundaries
   - Platform-specific error presentation

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for command logic
   - Integration tests with adapters
   - Mock implementations for dependencies

This implementation provides a model for future command migrations, ensuring consistent patterns across the system.

#### Workflow State Machine Implementation

The Workflow System implementation is now complete with the following components and features:

1. **Core State Management**
   - `WorkflowState` class with immutable state transitions
   - Support for linear and complex branching workflows
   - Step-based workflow definition with validation and processing
   - History tracking and backward navigation

2. **Workflow Building**
   - `WorkflowSequence` for defining reusable workflow templates
   - `WorkflowBuilder` utilities for creating common workflow patterns
   - Step validation and preprocessing/postprocessing hooks

3. **Session Integration**
   - Workflow persistence in user sessions
   - Serialization and deserialization of workflow state
   - Methods for storing, retrieving, and managing workflows
   - Support for finding and filtering workflows by name or type

4. **Platform Adaptation**
   - Telegram-specific rendering of workflow steps
   - Processing of Telegram messages and callbacks
   - Support for various input types (text, options, images, etc.)

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Detailed unit tests for all workflow components
   - Integration tests with session management
   - Tests for Telegram-specific adapters
   - Mock implementations for testing in isolation

This implementation provides a solid foundation for building complex multi-step interactions that work consistently across different platforms, with strong separation between business logic and UI concerns.

#### Command Router Design (Planned)

The Command Router will provide a centralized system for command registration and execution with these key features:

1. **Command Registry**
   - Dynamic command registration
   - Command metadata and discovery
   - Command grouping and categorization

2. **Middleware Pipeline**
   - Pre and post command execution hooks
   - Cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, etc.)
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Platform Adapters**
   - Abstract command interface
   - Platform-specific command interpreters
   - Context mapping between platforms

4. **Permission and Rate Limiting**
   - Command-level permission checking
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - Usage tracking and analytics

The Command Router will serve as the central coordination point for all command execution, providing a consistent interface across the system.

#### Workflow System Design (Planned)

The Workflow System will manage multi-step interactions with these key features:

1. **State Machine Core**
   - Immutable workflow state
   - Explicit state transitions
   - Event-based state changes

2. **Step Definition**
   - Sequential and conditional step execution
   - Step validation and preprocessing
   - Recovery and rollback mechanisms

3. **Persistence and Recovery**
   - Workflow state persistence
   - Session integration
   - Resumable workflows

4. **Platform Independence**
   - Abstract UI interactions
   - Platform-specific rendering
   - Consistent workflow across platforms

The Workflow System will provide a structured approach to complex interactions, ensuring consistency and reliability.
