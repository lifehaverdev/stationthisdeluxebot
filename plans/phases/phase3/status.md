# Phase 3: Workflow and Interaction Refactoring ‚Äî Status Update

## Overview
This document tracks progress through Phase 3 of the system refactor. Following the successful implementation of core state management and data access systems in Phase 2, our focus has shifted to refactoring multi-step interactions into a platform-agnostic workflow system and enabling execution of commands across different platforms (Telegram, web interface, etc.).

The recent architecture and test suite audits have revealed both significant progress and areas requiring attention before Phase 4 can begin.

## Goals
- Create a platform-agnostic command processing framework
- Implement a workflow system for multi-step interactions
- Extract UI rendering from business logic
- Implement proper validation for all user inputs
- Continue migrating high-value commands to the new architecture
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all new components

## üîÑ In Progress

### Command Migration
- [ ] Continue migrating high-value commands to new architecture
  - **Progress**: Initial command router architecture complete, `/status` command and `/make` command migrated with tests
  - **Blockers**: Missing tests for media commands
  - **Priority**: High - critical for Phase 4 readiness
  - **Test Status**: `statusCommand.test.js` and `makeCommand.e2e.test.js` complete; missing tests for `accountCommands.js` and `mediaCommand.js`

### UI Component Integration with Workflows
- [ ] Integrate UI components with workflow system
  - **Progress**: Base UI components implemented, but integration with complex workflows incomplete
  - **Blockers**: Integration tests between components and workflows missing
  - **Priority**: Medium-High - needed for consistent user experience
  - **Test Status**: Individual UI component tests exist, but integration tests with workflow missing

### Service Layer Testing
- [ ] Add tests for critical services
  - **Progress**: Core domain service tests mostly complete, but application services lack coverage
  - **Blockers**: 6/8 services in `src/services/` have no tests
  - **Priority**: High - critical for Phase 4 readiness
  - **Test Status**: 
    - ‚úÖ Completed: `fry.js` (22 tests passing)
    - Missing tests for `assist.js`, `speak.js`, `tripo.js`, `waterMark.js`; partial coverage for `comfydeploy/`

### Complex Workflow Implementation
- [ ] Create workflow implementations for complex user journeys
  - **Progress**: Basic workflow frameworks complete, `/make` workflow implemented and tested
  - **Blockers**: Missing workflow definitions for additional user journeys
  - **Priority**: High - critical for user experience consistency
  - **Test Status**: Core workflow framework well-tested, `/make` workflow fully covered with E2E tests

## üîç Discovered Architectural Drift

Based on the recent audit, several areas have evolved beyond the original plan:

1. **UI Component Architecture** - The `core/ui/` module has evolved into a sophisticated component system that exceeds the original plan's vision. This represents a positive enhancement that enables true platform independence.

2. **Validation Framework** - The validation system in `core/validation/` has become more comprehensive than initially envisioned, providing consistent input validation across the codebase.

3. **Workflow System** - The workflow implementation with `WorkflowSequence`, `WorkflowState`, and `WorkflowStep` is more sophisticated and flexible than initially planned.

4. **Analytics System** - The analytics tracking in `core/analytics/` emerged organically but needs better integration with the architecture.

5. **Service Layer Organization** - The distinction between services in `src/services/` and those in `src/core/*/service.js` has become blurred and needs clarification.

6. **Test Organization** - Test files are inconsistently located between `tests/` and `src/core/*/tests/` directories.

7. **Workflow Implementations** - Multiple implementations of the same workflow (e.g., MakeImageWorkflow) were found in different directories. These have been consolidated to follow the clean architecture principles, with the definitive implementation now in `src/core/workflow/workflows/`.

## üöß Blockers for Phase 4

The following items must be addressed before progressing to Phase 4:

1. **Account Command Testing**
   - Account management commands are partially migrated with insufficient test coverage
   - Need comprehensive tests for account points management, settings, and preferences
   - **Required Action**: Create tests in `tests/commands/accountCommands.test.js`

2. **Image Generation Pipeline Testing**
   - Core functionality with partial migration and limited tests
   - Missing tests for workflow integration, error recovery, and point deduction
   - **Required Action**: Create end-to-end tests for the image generation process

3. **UI Component Integration Tests**
   - Individual components are tested but integration with workflow engine is not
   - Missing tests for platform-specific rendering adapters
   - **Required Action**: Create integration tests for UI components and workflows

4. **Service Layer Test Coverage**
   - Critical services lack test coverage
   - **Required Action**: Create tests for all services in `src/services/`

5. **Consistent Test Location**
   - Tests are split between `tests/` and `src/core/*/tests/` directories
   - **Required Action**: Standardize test location and naming conventions

## üìã Current Priorities

1. **High-Value Command Migration**
   - ‚úÖ Migrated `makeCommand.js` with comprehensive E2E tests

3. **End-to-End Workflow Testing**
   - ‚úÖ Created E2E tests for image generation workflow
   - Create tests for account management workflows
   - Test platform-specific adapters for these workflows
   - Validate proper point deduction and error handling
   - **Success Criteria**: Test coverage for all critical user workflows

4. **Test Organization Standardization**
   - Move tests from `src/core/*/tests/` to `tests/core/*/`
   - Standardize test file naming conventions
   - Update test documentation
   - **Success Criteria**: All tests follow consistent location and naming patterns

5. **Command and Integration Test Framework**
   - ‚úÖ Created standardized testing framework for commands
   - Add support for testing platform-specific integrations
   - **Success Criteria**: Framework allows easy testing of new commands and integrations
