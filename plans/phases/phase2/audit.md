   - Built comprehensive adapter pattern for legacy compatibility
   - Achieved full test coverage with proper mocking

2. **MongoDB Repository Integration**
   - Established base repository pattern
   - Implemented connection pooling and error handling
   - Created factory pattern for repository management
   - Added monitoring and event emission

3. **State Container Architecture**
   - Delivered immutable state pattern with version tracking
   - Implemented efficient update mechanisms
   - Added history tracking and memoization
   - Created comprehensive documentation

4. **Task Queue Refactoring**
   - Migrated from global arrays to immutable TaskState
   - Implemented proper state machine for task lifecycle
   - Added retry logic and rate limiting
   - Created event-based monitoring system

5. **Error Handling System**
