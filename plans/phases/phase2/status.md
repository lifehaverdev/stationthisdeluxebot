## Phase 2: State Management and Data Access ‚Äî Status Tracker

### Overview
This document tracks progress through Phase 2 of the system refactor. The goal is to replace ad-hoc global state and database access with structured services, repositories, and immutable state containers.

### Goals
- Eliminate uncontrolled mutation of `lobby`, `workspace`, and other global state
- Create explicit session lifecycle logic
- Centralize and modularize all MongoDB access
- Lay groundwork for proper testing and error boundaries

---

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Session management module implementation
  - Created `src/core/session/` directory with `models.js`, `repository.js`, `service.js`, and `adapter.js`
  - Implemented immutable `SessionState` with proper version tracking
  - Added platform-agnostic client connection tracking
  - Built test suite in `tests/core/session/session.test.js`
  - Fixed issues with importing/exporting modules
  - All tests are now passing
- [x] Created example of replacing `lobby[userId]` with adapter
  - Created `src/core/session/examples/lobby-replacement.js` 
  - Demonstrated best practices for migrating from legacy code
  - Added web interface support with API keys
- [x] Fixed test suites for core modules
  - Fixed `UserService` tests to properly mock event bus
  - Fixed `PointsService` tests for event emission 
  - Fixed `GenerationService` tests with proper mock implementation
  - All core service tests are now passing

### üõ†Ô∏è In Progress
- [ ] MongoDB repository integration
  - Base Repository interface implemented
  - Need to connect to actual MongoDB instance

### üîú Upcoming
- [ ] Replacing first actual `lobby[userId]` instances with adapter
- [ ] Introduce `StateContainer` class for in-memory immutability
- [ ] Refactor `queue.js` to use a proper TaskQueue model
- [ ] Implement central `MongoRepositoryFactory` to generate repository instances
- [ ] Standardize error formats with core `AppError` class

---

### Notes
- Global state phase-out must be **incremental** to avoid breaking running sessions.
- Every replacement module should include:
  - Unit tests
  - Backward-compatible data converters (where needed)
  - Readme.md inside its folder documenting API surface and goals

### Progress Details

#### Session Management Module

The Session system now provides a platform-agnostic way to manage user sessions with the following key features:

1. **Immutable State Pattern**
   - `SessionState` is immutable (frozen) to prevent side effects
   - State updates create new state objects with version tracking
   - Efficient updates through shallow property copying

2. **Multiple Client Support**
   - Added support for Telegram, Web, and API clients
   - Client-specific connection tracking
   - API key generation and validation

3. **Legacy Compatibility**
   - `SessionAdapter` provides bidirectional sync with legacy `lobby`
   - Supports gradual migration from global state
   - Example code demonstrating how to replace lobby access

4. **Maintainable Abstractions**
   - Clear separation of concerns between models, repository, and service
   - Full test coverage with mocked dependencies
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Complete interface for other modules to interact with

5. **Clean Architecture Implementation**
   - Proper dependency injection through constructors
   - Event-based communication between components
   - Factory methods for easier system creation
   - Consistent error handling and validation

The implementation follows clean architecture principles:
- **Core Domain Logic**: `SessionModel` and `SessionState` 
- **Data Access**: `SessionRepository` with in-memory storage
- **Business Logic**: `SessionService` with lifecycle management
- **Integration Layer**: `SessionAdapter` for backward compatibility

The next step is to integrate this with a real use case by replacing a specific instance of `lobby[userId]` access in the production codebase.

---

### üß† Integration Strategy
- Use legacy `lobby` and `workspace` code only as a reference for *behavior*, not structure
- Design from first principles using clean architecture and immutable state
- Build a flexible system that accommodates both legacy Telegram and new web interface
- Create comprehensive tests to ensure reliability during migration
- Document the entire API surface in README.md

### üìù Notes for Tomorrow

**Morning priorities:**
1. Implement MongoDB connection for repositories
   - Create MongoRepository base class extending Repository
   - Implement connection pooling and error handling
   - Add test for MongoDB integration with test database

2. Begin practical lobby replacement
   - Identify 2-3 simple use cases in the codebase that access lobby directly
   - Create migration plan for each use case
   - Implement first replacement and test functionality

3. Work on StateContainer class
   - Create general-purpose immutable state container
   - Ensure it works with complex nested objects
   - Add versioning and efficient update mechanisms

**Reference resources:**
- Completed session module tests provide good patterns to follow
- Use event bus patterns for communication between modules
- MongoDB documentation for proper connection handling
