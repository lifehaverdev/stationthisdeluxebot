# Web Adapter Planning/Initiation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of planning and initiating the web adapter for stationthisdeluxebot. Based on the 2025-04-21 audit and general direction reset, web adapter planning is identified as a medium priority for Phase 4.

## Goals
- Design web interface integration architecture
- Prototype key user flows in web context
- Adapt platform-agnostic components to web rendering
- Ensure consistent UX across platforms
- Create responsive and accessible web interface
- Maintain clean separation between web-specific code and core logic

## Current Status: 🟡 PLANNING PHASE

### Completed Features
- ✅ Initial web server infrastructure
- ✅ Basic API routing for web requests
- ✅ Authentication concept design

### In-Progress Features
- 🔄 Architecture planning
- 🔄 User flow mapping
- 🔄 Component adaptation strategy
- 🔄 Technology stack selection

### Not Started
- ❌ Web UI implementation
- ❌ Web-specific command adapters
- ❌ Web renderer for UI components
- ❌ Session management for web
- ❌ Testing infrastructure for web components

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Architecture Documentation | 100% | 35% | 🟠 In Progress |
| UI Component Adaptation | 100% | 5% | 🔴 Not Started |
| User Flow Mapping | 100% | 30% | 🟠 In Progress |
| Web-specific Testing | 80% | 0% | 🔴 Not Started |

## Dependencies
- Core workflow system for web interactions
- Platform-agnostic UI components
- Services layer for business logic
- Authentication system for user verification
- API layer development

## Blockers
- API layer development needed for web integration
- Platform-agnostic UI components need refinement for web context
- Technology stack selection pending finalization
- Session management strategy needs definition for web context

## Next Tasks (Prioritized)
1. Complete Architecture Documentation
   - Define overall architecture approach
   - Document interface between web and core components
   - Create technology stack requirements
   - Establish design system guidelines
   - Determine session management strategy

2. Map Critical User Flows
   - Identify key user journeys for web interface
   - Create wireframes for primary workflows
   - Document UI state transitions
   - Define responsive design approach
   - Prototype key interactions

3. Adapt UI Components
   - Create web-specific renderers for core UI components
   - Implement responsive design patterns
   - Establish accessibility standards
   - Create component development guidelines
   - Build initial component library

4. Implement Session Management
   - Design cookie-based or JWT authentication
   - Create user login and registration flows
   - Implement session persistence
   - Develop user profile management
   - Build authentication middleware

5. Create Testing Framework
   - Establish web-specific testing patterns
   - Implement component unit tests
   - Create integration test approach
   - Define end-to-end testing strategy
   - Set up testing utilities and helpers

## Timeline
