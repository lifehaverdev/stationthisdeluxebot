# Database Module Audit

## 🧾 Folder Overview

The database module handles data persistence and storage concerns for the application. It appears to be structured in a way that abstracts database access behind models, potentially implementing a repository pattern to separate business logic from data access mechanisms.

This folder seems relatively minimal, possibly because the application is in transition towards a new architecture with more sophisticated data access patterns.

## 📁 Subdirectories

### models/
Contains database model definitions, likely implementing data access objects or repositories for different entity types. Currently contains at least one model for analytics events.

#### models/analyticsEvents.js
Implements data access for analytics events, possibly tracking user interactions, system events, or other metrics for monitoring and analysis.

## 🛠️ Service/Dependency Notes

The database module likely depends on:
- Database drivers or ODM/ORM libraries
- Configuration settings for database connection
- Schema definitions for data structures

The module avoids exposing database implementation details to the rest of the application, instead providing models that encapsulate data access.

## 📌 Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- May use utilities from `src/utils` for logging, error handling, etc.
- Likely uses configuration from `src/config` for database connection settings

### Dependencies from other folders:
- Core domain repositories might implement interfaces defined in `src/core`
- Services may use these models for data persistence
- Command handlers might use these models for storing and retrieving data

## Technical Debt Notes

- The database structure seems minimal, with only analyticsEvents currently visible
- There may be direct database access in other parts of the codebase rather than going through this module
- The transition to a clean architecture approach may require more robust repository implementations
- The relationship between these database models and the domain models in core is unclear
