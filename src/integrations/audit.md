# Integrations Module Audit

## üßæ Folder Overview

The integrations module handles connections to external platforms and services, providing adapters that allow the core business logic to interact with various delivery mechanisms. Each subdirectory represents a specific platform or service integration.

This folder implements the outermost layer of the clean architecture, bridging the gap between external interfaces and the core application.

## üìÅ Subdirectories

### telegram/
Contains implementation for Telegram Bot integration, including message handling, command routing, and API interactions. This is likely the primary user interface for the application.

### web/
Implements web-based interfaces, potentially including REST APIs, webhooks, or web dashboards for monitoring and control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Service/Dependency Notes

The integrations module depends on:
- External platform SDKs (Telegram Bot API, etc.)
- Core domain services for business logic
- Command implementations for user interaction
- Session management for stateful interactions

The integrations act as adapters between external platforms and the internal application architecture, translating between platform-specific models and domain models.

## üìå Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- `src/core` for domain services and business logic
- `src/commands` for command handling logic
- `src/services` for specialized operations
- `src/utils` for formatting, error handling, and logging

### Dependencies from other folders:
- `src/bootstrap.js` initializes and configures integrations
- The core application primarily interacts with users through these integrations

## Platform-Specific Concerns

### Telegram Integration
- Handles Telegram Bot API interactions
- Routes user messages to appropriate command handlers
- Manages Telegram-specific formatting and media handling
- Likely maintains Telegram session state

### Web Integration
- Potentially provides HTTP/REST endpoints
- May include admin dashboards or monitoring interfaces
- Could handle webhooks for external service integration
