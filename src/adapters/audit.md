# Adapters Module Audit

## 🧾 Folder Overview

The adapters module implements the adapter pattern to bridge between different components or systems, providing translation layers that allow disparate parts of the system to communicate. This is a key architectural component for achieving separation of concerns and implementing clean architecture.

## 📁 File-by-file Summary

There are no visible files in the listing, but the folder likely contains adapters for:

- Database access adapters
- External API adapters
- Legacy system adapters
- Storage adapters
- Platform-specific adapters

## 🛠️ Service/Dependency Notes

The adapters module:
- Depends on external systems or libraries that it adapts
- Provides standardized interfaces for the rest of the application
- Isolates the application from implementation details of external dependencies
- May implement various design patterns like Repository, Gateway, or Facade

## 📌 Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- May use `src/utils` for helper functions
- May use `src/config` for configuration settings

### Dependencies from other folders:
- Core domain services likely depend on adapters for external interactions
- Integration modules may use adapters for accessing core functionality
- API endpoints may use adapters for data access

## Technical Debt Notes

- Some adapter implementations may be incomplete
- The boundary between adapters and direct integration code might be blurry
- Consistency in adapter interfaces across different external systems may vary
- Documentation for adapter usage patterns might be lacking
