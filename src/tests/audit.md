# Tests Module Audit

## 🧾 Folder Overview

The tests module contains automated tests for validating the functionality and correctness of the application. This likely includes unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests that help ensure the system works as expected and prevent regressions when changes are made.

## 📁 File-by-file Summary

There are no visible files in the listing, but the folder likely contains:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Test utilities and helpers
- Mock data and fixtures
- Test configuration

## 🛠️ Service/Dependency Notes

The tests module likely depends on:
- A testing framework (such as Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- Assertion libraries
- Mocking utilities
- The actual application code being tested

Tests should be isolated from external dependencies through mocking or test doubles to ensure reliable test execution.

## 📌 Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- All other folders in the application that contain code to be tested
- May use utilities from `src/utils` for testing helpers

### Dependencies from other folders:
- Should have minimal or no dependencies from application code
- CI/CD pipelines likely run these tests during deployment

## Technical Debt Notes

- Test coverage may be incomplete
- Some areas of the codebase may lack automated tests
- Integration tests for external services may be challenging to maintain
- Testing of Telegram-specific functionality may require complex mocks
