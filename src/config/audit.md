# Configuration Module Audit

## 🧾 Folder Overview

The configuration module contains settings, parameters, and feature flags that control the behavior of the application. This centralized configuration approach makes it easier to manage application settings across different environments and toggle features without code changes.

## 📁 File-by-file Summary

There are no visible files in the listing, but the folder likely contains files such as:

- Environment-specific configuration files
- Feature flag definitions
- API keys and service configuration
- System parameters and constants

## 🛠️ Service/Dependency Notes

The configuration module:
- Should have minimal dependencies on other parts of the application
- May use environment variables for sensitive settings
- May implement a layered approach (defaults, environment overrides, etc.)
- May include feature flag management

The configuration settings are likely consumed by various parts of the application to control behavior.

## 📌 Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- Should have minimal or no dependencies on other application components
- May use utilities from `src/utils` for loading or validating configuration

### Dependencies from other folders:
- Used throughout the entire codebase
- Referenced in bootstrap.js for application initialization
- Core and service modules likely depend on configuration settings
- Integrations may use platform-specific configuration

## Technical Debt Notes

- Configuration management strategy may not be fully centralized
- Some settings might be hardcoded in application code rather than in configuration
- Documentation for configuration options may be incomplete
- Configuration validation may be lacking
