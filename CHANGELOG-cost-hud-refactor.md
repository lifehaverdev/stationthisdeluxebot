# Cost HUD Event-Driven Refactor - CHANGELOG

## Performance & Logging Improvements

### üöÄ Performance Enhancements
- **Eliminated 2-second polling interval** - Removed `updateInterval` that was calling `updateDisplay()` every 2 seconds
- **Reduced CPU usage** - Cost HUD now only updates when relevant events occur, not continuously
- **Eliminated console spam** - No more periodic log flooding from unnecessary updates

### üîß Event-Driven Architecture
- **Replaced polling with targeted events** - Cost HUD now responds to specific events:
  - `costUpdate` - When window costs change
  - `costResetAll` - When all costs are reset
  - `toolWindowAdded` - When new tool windows are added
  - `toolWindowRemoved` - When tool windows are removed
  - `denominationChange` - When user cycles through denominations
  - `exchangeRatesUpdated` - When exchange rates are refreshed
- **Maintained accuracy** - All functionality preserved while improving efficiency

### üêõ Debug Logging Controls
- **Added `hudDebug()` helper** - Gated by `window.DEBUG_COST_LOGS` flag
- **Added `stateDebug()` helper** - Gated by `window.DEBUG_COST_LOGS` flag
- **Replaced verbose console logs** - All `console.log`/`console.warn` calls now use debug helpers
- **Noise-free by default** - Clean console output unless debug mode is enabled
- **Easy debugging** - Enable with `window.DEBUG_COST_LOGS = true`

### üìÅ Files Modified
- `src/platforms/web/client/src/sandbox/components/costHud.js`
  - Removed `startPeriodicUpdates()` method
  - Added `startExchangeRateRefresh()` method (1-hour interval only)
  - Added `hudDebug()` helper function
  - Replaced all console logs with `hudDebug()`
  - Added event listeners for `denominationChange` and `exchangeRatesUpdated`
  - Updated method names for clarity

- `src/platforms/web/client/src/sandbox/state.js`
  - Added `stateDebug()` helper function
  - Replaced verbose console logs with `stateDebug()`
  - Maintained all existing functionality

### üß™ Testing
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - All event listeners verified
- **Functionality preservation** - Window management, cost updates, denomination cycling all work
- **Performance validation** - No more unnecessary polling or console spam
- **Debug controls tested** - Logging can be enabled/disabled as needed

### üí° Usage
```javascript
// Default: Clean console (no debug logs)
// Cost HUD updates only on relevant events

// Enable debug logging
window.DEBUG_COST_LOGS = true;

// Disable debug logging
window.DEBUG_COST_LOGS = false;
```

### üéØ Benefits
- **Better performance** - Eliminated unnecessary 2-second polling
- **Cleaner console** - No more log spam during normal operation
- **Easier debugging** - Controlled debug output when needed
- **Maintained functionality** - All existing features work exactly as before
- **Better architecture** - Event-driven updates are more efficient and maintainable

*This refactor improves the Cost HUD's performance and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality and adding better debugging controls.*
