# HANDOFF: 2025-05-22 - Settings API & Telegram UX Prep

## Work Completed

*   **`UserSettingsService` Authentication Fix:**
    *   Modified `UserSettingsService` methods (`getEffectiveSettings`, `savePreferences`, `getResolvedInput`) to accept an `internalApiKey` parameter. This allows the calling context (e.g., a platform adapter) to specify the appropriate API key for internal API calls.
    *   Updated the `internalApiClient` instance within these methods to use the provided `internalApiKey` in the `X-Internal-Client-Key` header, overriding any default key.
*   **Telegram Platform Integration (`dynamicCommands.js`):**
    *   Updated the `bot.onText` handler in `src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js`.
    *   The call to `services.userSettingsService.getResolvedInput` now correctly passes `process.env.INTERNAL_API_KEY_TELEGRAM` as the `internalApiKey`.
*   **Successful Test & Validation:**
    *   Logs confirm that the Telegram platform, when resolving inputs for a tool, now successfully authenticates with the internal `userPreferencesApi`.
    *   User-specific preferences are being correctly fetched and merged with tool defaults and user input, as demonstrated by the `input_seed` example in the logs.
    *   This resolves the previous `401 Unauthorized` error when `UserSettingsService` attempted to access user preferences.

## Current State

*   The core `UserSettingsService` is functional for retrieving and resolving user preferences with tool defaults and user-provided input.
*   The mechanism for platforms to securely call `UserSettingsService` using their own internal API keys is implemented and tested for the Telegram platform.
*   User preferences are now automatically applied for tool executions initiated via Telegram dynamic commands, effectively enabling per-user, per-tool default parameter settings.
*   The API methods required by ADR-006 for fetching user settings (`GET /preferences/:toolId` via `UserSettingsService.getEffectiveSettings` or `getResolvedInput`) and saving them (`PUT /preferences/:toolId` via `UserSettingsService.savePreferences`) are in place and the service layer is correctly authenticating.

## Next Tasks

The immediate next focus is on improving the Telegram platform UX to leverage the new settings capabilities and prepare for a `/settings` command/menu:

1.  **Telegram `/settings` Command Scaffolding:**
    *   Design the initial interaction flow for a `/settings` command on Telegram.
    *   What should happen when a user types `/settings`?
        *   Option A: List all tools they have used (requires `GET /users/:masterAccountId/used-tools` endpoint to be fully utilized by Telegram).
        *   Option B: Ask "Settings for which tool? (e.g., /settings ImageGen)".
        *   Option C: A combination, or a more guided experience with inline keyboards.
    *   Implement the basic command handler for `/settings` in `src/platforms/telegram/commands/settingsCommand.js` (or a similar new file).
2.  **Displaying Current Settings:**
    *   Once a tool is selected (e.g., `/settings ImageGen`), fetch and display its current *effective* settings for the user.
    *   This will involve calling `userSettingsService.getEffectiveSettings(masterAccountId, toolId, telegramApiKey)`.
    *   Format the settings display in a user-friendly way in a Telegram message (e.g., "ImageGen Settings:\n- CFG Scale: 7.0 (Default: 7.0)\n- Steps: 25 (Your Preference)").
3.  **Modifying Settings (Initial Approach):**
    *   Design a simple mechanism for users to modify a single setting at a time via a command, e.g., `/set ImageGen cfg_scale 8.5`.
    *   This command would:
        *   Parse the tool, parameter, and value.
        *   Call `userSettingsService.savePreferences(masterAccountId, toolId, { [paramName]: value }, telegramApiKey)`.
        *   Provide feedback to the user on success or failure (including validation errors from `validatePreferences`).
4.  **Exploring Inline Keyboards for Settings Navigation:**
    *   Investigate using Telegram inline keyboards for a more interactive settings experience:
        *   Listing tools for which settings can be modified.
        *   Listing parameters for a selected tool.
        *   Presenting common options for a parameter (e.g., boolean toggles, common numeric values).
5.  **`DELETE /preferences/:toolId` Integration:**
    *   Plan for a "reset to defaults" option for a specific tool within the `/settings` flow, which would utilize the `DELETE /users/:masterAccountId/preferences/:toolId` API endpoint (via a new `userSettingsService.deletePreferences(masterAccountId, toolId, internalApiKey)` method if we want to keep API calls within the service).

## Changes to Plan

*   No major deviations from ADR-006. The current work directly enables its goals.
*   The focus is shifting from backend API implementation to platform-level (Telegram) UX and feature implementation based on the new service.

## Open Questions

1.  For the initial `/settings` command, what is the preferred user interaction flow to select a tool? (List used tools, direct tool name input, etc.)
2.  Should `UserSettingsService` have a dedicated `deletePreferences(masterAccountId, toolId, internalApiKey)` method that calls the `DELETE` endpoint, or should platforms call that API endpoint directly (via `internalApiClient`) after confirming with the user? (Adding it to the service seems more consistent).
3.  What level of detail should be shown when displaying current settings? Just the user's preference, or also the tool's default for comparison?
