# HANDOFF: 2025-07-02 - Upload Issue

## Work Completed
- **Initial Diagnosis**: Identified that the client-side was receiving a signed upload URL from the server but was not performing the actual file upload (`PUT` request) to that URL.
- **Client-Side Fix**: Patched `src/platforms/web/client/src/sandbox.js` to execute the `PUT` request to the signed URL provided by the backend.
- **CORS Debugging**: Encountered and began debugging a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error, which blocked the browser from sending the file to the Cloudflare R2 bucket.
- **CORS Policy Iteration**: Attempted several CORS policy configurations on the R2 bucket to explicitly allow requests from the production domain (`https://noema.art`) and local development (`http://localhost:4000`).
- **Header Refinement**: Modified the client-side `uploadFile` function multiple times to ensure the correct `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `x-amz-*` headers were being sent with the `PUT` request.
- **Server-Side Refinement**: Updated the `generateSignedUploadUrl` function in `src/core/services/storageService.js` to better align with Cloudflare's R2/S3 pre-signed URL specifications, including adding a `ChecksumAlgorithm`.

## Current State
The system is still unable to upload files from the web client to the R2 bucket. The client successfully retrieves a signed URL, but the subsequent `PUT` request to R2 fails. The root cause appears to be a persistent mismatch between the browser's request, the R2 bucket's CORS policy, and the signature of the pre-signed URL. The latest attempts to align these components based on Cloudflare's documentation have not yet resolved the issue.

## Next Tasks
1.  **Verify CORS and Headers**: Confirm that the most recently recommended CORS policy has been applied to the R2 bucket and has had time to propagate.
2.  **Inspect Final Request**: Meticulously inspect the headers of the final, failing `PUT` request in the browser's developer tools to check for any discrepancies with the CORS policy's `AllowedHeaders`.
3.  **Investigate Network Layers**: Determine if any intermediate layers (such as the Caddy reverse proxy) could be altering or stripping headers, which would invalidate the signed URL's signature.
4.  **Confirm Credentials**: Double-check that all `R2_*` environment variables are correctly loaded and utilized by the `storageService` when generating the signed URL.

## Changes to Plan
None. This is a bug-fixing effort and does not deviate from the main architectural plan.

## Open Questions
- Is there a delay in the propagation of the R2 CORS policy that we are not accounting for?
- Could the Caddy server configuration be interfering with the required headers for the upload request?
- Are we certain that the AWS SDK version and the `getSignedUrl` function are behaving as expected with Cloudflare's R2 implementation?
