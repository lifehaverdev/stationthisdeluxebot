# HANDOFF: 2025-06-30

## Work Completed

- **Implemented Alchemy Webhook Security**:
  - Created `src/core/services/alchemy/webhookUtils.js` with signature verification middleware
  - Added environment variable check for `ALCHEMY_SIGNING_KEY`
  - Implemented timing-safe signature comparison to prevent attacks
  - Added comprehensive error handling that maintains Alchemy webhook stability

- **Updated Web Routes**:
  - Modified `/api/webhook/alchemy` endpoint to use new security middleware
  - Maintained existing success/error handling and logging patterns
  - Added startup validation for required environment variables

- **Documentation**:
  - Created detailed README in `src/core/services/alchemy/README.md`
  - Added sequence diagrams for webhook flow
  - Documented testing procedures and security measures
  - Provided curl examples for endpoint verification

## Current State

The Alchemy webhook endpoint is now properly secured with the following features:
- HMAC SHA-256 signature verification
- Timing attack prevention
- Proper error status codes (401 for auth failures)
- Maintained 200 OK responses for Alchemy stability
- Environment variable configuration

The system is ready for webhook testing and deployment.

## Next Tasks

1. **Testing**:
   - Create automated tests for webhook authentication
   - Add integration tests with mock Alchemy payloads
   - Test error handling scenarios

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Add metrics for webhook authentication failures
   - Set up alerts for repeated auth failures
   - Monitor webhook reliability

3. **Documentation**:
   - Add webhook setup instructions to deployment guide
   - Document webhook retry/failure handling procedures
   - Create runbook for webhook troubleshooting

## Changes to Plan
No deviations from REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md. This security implementation aligns with the existing architecture and maintains proper service boundaries.

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement rate limiting on the webhook endpoint?
2. Do we need to add IP allowlisting in addition to signature verification?
3. Should we add a webhook request/response logging system for debugging?
4. What metrics should we track for webhook reliability?
