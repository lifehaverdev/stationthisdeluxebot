# HANDOFF: 2025-07-11 â€” Sandbox UI/UX Improvements

## Work Completed
- **Session Start:** Identified and prioritized three major pain points in the sandbox UI:
  1. Tool windows are not draggable on mobile devices (touch support missing)
  2. Generated images cannot be viewed full-size or in an overlay
  3. Workspace does not support zooming or panning (static viewport)
- Reviewed the current sandbox UI architecture and code structure
- Established a plan to address each pain point in sequence, following the AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL
- **Implemented and tested touch drag support for tool windows on mobile devices**
- **Improved drag responsiveness by removing CSS transition smoothing from .tool-window**
- **Implemented full-size image overlay/modal for generated images (pending production test)**
- **Refactored workspace to use logical grid coordinates for tool window placement**
- **Implemented zoom and pan for the workspace, with all tool windows and grid moving/scaling together**
- **Restored and debugged the action modal, create submenu, and tool selection modal; all are now fully functional**
- **Removed all debug styles and logging; UI is ready for further polish and new features**

## Current State
- Tool windows are draggable with both mouse and touch (mobile and desktop)
- Dragging is instant and responsive on all devices
- Generated images are clickable and open a full-size overlay/modal
- Workspace supports zoom and pan, with a logical grid system for tool window placement
- Action modal, create submenu, and tool selection modal are fully functional and visually polished

## Next Tasks
- Polish the workspace zoom/pan and grid system for usability and aesthetics
- Consider adding snapping, boundaries, or advanced grid features
- Test image overlay/modal after deployment to production

## Changes to Plan
- No deviations from the refactor or collaboration protocols; this work aligns with the current UI/UX improvement phase

## Open Questions
- Should the image overlay support pinch-to-zoom and swipe navigation for multiple images?
- What is the preferred gesture/UI for workspace pan/zoom on mobile (two-finger drag, pinch, etc.)?
- Should tool windows snap to a grid or have boundaries when dragging/panning/zooming?
