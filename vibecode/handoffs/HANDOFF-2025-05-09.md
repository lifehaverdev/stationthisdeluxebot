# HANDOFF: 2025-05-09

## Work Completed

This session focused on laying the groundwork for the new Internal API layer for database services, as outlined in `ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md`.

Key accomplishments include:

1.  **Project-wide Naming Convention Update**:
    *   Reviewed and updated terminology to avoid the term "Noema" for database services.
    *   Modified `src/core/services/db/index.js` to rename the `noema` namespace to `data` (e.g., `services.db.data.userCore`).

2.  **Internal API Scaffolding (`src/api/internal/index.js`)**:
    *   Introduced `express.Router()` to manage internal API routes.
    *   Refactored `initializeInternalServices` to support modular API service integration and return the main router.

3.  **Dependency Injection Fixes**:
    *   Ensured correct propagation of database services (`dbService`) down to the internal API layer:
        *   Modified `src/core/services/index.js` to pass `db: dbService` to `initializeAPI`.
        *   Modified `src/api/index.js` to pass `db: options.db` to `initializeInternalServices`.
    *   This resolved initial startup errors related to "Database services not found."

4.  **Router Mounting in Main Application (`app.js`)**:
    *   The main internal API router (`services.internal.router`) is now mounted in `app.js` under the base path `/internal/v1/data/`, making the new API endpoints accessible.

5.  **User Core API Service - Stub Implementation (`src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js`)**:
    *   Created the first API service module for "User Core" as specified in `ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md`.
    *   This module (`userCoreApi.js`) exports a function that creates an Express router.
    *   All User Core endpoints (e.g., `/find-or-create`, `/{masterAccountId}`, `/by-platform/{platform}/{platformId}`, wallet endpoints, API key endpoints) are defined as stubs, currently returning `501 Not Implemented`.
    *   The service correctly receives `logger` and `db` (specifically `db.data.userCore`) dependencies.

6.  **User Core API Service Integration**:
    *   The `userCoreApiRouter` is now imported and mounted within `src/api/internal/index.js` under the `/users` path. This makes its endpoints available at `/internal/v1/data/users/...`.

## Current State

*   The foundational structure for the new internal API, adhering to `ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md`, is established and functional.
*   The User Core API service endpoints are defined, stubbed, and correctly routed. They are accessible via HTTP requests (e.g., `GET /internal/v1/data/users/some-id`).
*   Dependency injection for database services to the internal API layer is verified and working.
*   The system starts up without the previous critical errors concerning missing database dependencies for the API layer. The remaining unrelated error `[Telegram] UserCoreDB service not available for /noemainfome command` highlights an existing part of the system that will need refactoring to use this new API.

## Demonstration of Progress

Successful `curl` requests to the following stubbed User Core API endpoints have been verified:
*   `GET /internal/v1/data/users/test-master-account-id`
*   `POST /internal/v1/data/users/find-or-create` (with JSON body `{"platform": "testPlatform", "platformId": "testPlatformId123"}`)
*   `GET /internal/v1/data/users/by-platform/testPlatform/testPlatformId456`

All commands returned the expected `501 Not Implemented` JSON response, and application logs confirmed that the calls were routed to the correct handlers in `src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js`.

## Next Tasks

1.  **Implement User Core API Logic**:
    *   Transition the stubbed methods in `src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js` to full implementations, utilizing `dependencies.db.userCore` to perform the actual database operations as defined in `ADR-003-InternalAPIForNoemaServices.md`.

2.  **Implement Remaining API Services (Iterative Approach)**:
    *   For each of the other six services (User Sessions, User Events, User Economy, Transactions, User Preferences, Generation Outputs) outlined in `ADR-003`:
        *   Create the stubbed service file (e.g., `userSessionsApi.js`) within `src/api/internal/`.
        *   Integrate its router into `src/api/internal/index.js`.
        *   Verify routing with `curl` commands.
        *   Implement the business logic for its endpoints.

3.  **Refactor Platform Adapters & Core Workflows**:
    *   Gradually update platform adapters (`src/platforms/*`) and core workflows (`src/core/workflows/*`) to consume these new internal API endpoints instead of making direct calls to `services.db.data.*` objects, in line with the decisions in `ADR-003`.
    *   The `[Telegram] /noemainfome command` error noted during startup is an early candidate for this refactoring.

4.  **Authentication & Authorization**:
    *   Implement the "Per-Client API Key" strategy (Option 3 from `ADR-003`) for the internal API, likely involving a custom header (e.g., `X-Internal-Client-Key`) for requests from internal clients (Telegram adapter, Web backend, etc.).

5.  **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
    *   Ensure robust and consistent error handling across all internal API endpoints, adhering to the standard JSON error response format and HTTP status codes decided in `ADR-003`.

6.  **Testing**:
    *   Develop unit and integration tests for the internal API services and endpoints.

## Open Questions

*   None at this immediate juncture. The path forward for the next few services seems clear.
