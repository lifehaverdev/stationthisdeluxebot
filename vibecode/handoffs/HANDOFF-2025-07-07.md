# HANDOFF: 2025-07-07

## Work Completed
- Diagnosed and fixed CSRF token issues in the Buy Points modal (frontend now fetches CSRF token from /api/v1/csrf-token and includes it in all POSTs)
- Fixed BigInt conversion errors by ensuring frontend converts user input to smallest unit (using token decimals) before sending to backend
- Updated backend `/supported-assets` endpoint to include `decimals` for each token
- Refactored `/purchase` endpoint to:
  - Remove requirement for `userId` in POST body (now uses `userWalletAddress` exclusively)
  - Generate real transaction calldata for ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 using actual contract ABIs and addresses
  - Return approval and deposit transactions for ERC20, and transfer for ERC721
- Updated frontend to require wallet connection and include `userWalletAddress` in purchase requests

## Current State
- Buy Points modal successfully fetches supported assets and quotes
- Purchase step now prompts for wallet connection and sends correct transaction data to backend
- Backend returns real transaction objects for user to sign (no more mock calldata)
- Still debugging a 400 error on purchase: frontend appears to send `userWalletAddress`, but backend logs show it missing in some requests; further debugging needed to ensure wallet address is always present in POST body

## Next Tasks
- Add explicit frontend logging to verify `userWalletAddress` is always present in purchase POST body
- Confirm network tab shows correct payload; resolve any async or logic issues in wallet connection
- Complete end-to-end test: user connects wallet, gets quote, signs approval (if needed), and signs deposit/transfer
- Add Playwright or manual test to demonstrate full working flow

## Changes to Plan
- None; all changes align with the refactor and collaboration protocols

## Open Questions
- Is there any edge case where wallet connection is skipped or fails silently?
- Should we add more robust error handling or user feedback for wallet connection issues?
- Do we need to support additional asset types or custom coins in the modal?
