# HANDOFF: 2025-07-07

## Work Completed
- Diagnosed and fixed CSRF token issues in the Buy Points modal (frontend now fetches CSRF token from /api/v1/csrf-token and includes it in all POSTs)
- Fixed BigInt conversion errors by ensuring frontend converts user input to smallest unit (using token decimals) before sending to backend
- Updated backend `/supported-assets` endpoint to include `decimals` for each token
- Refactored `/purchase` endpoint to:
  - Remove requirement for `userId` in POST body (now uses `userWalletAddress` exclusively)
  - Generate real transaction calldata for ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 using actual contract ABIs and addresses
  - Return approval and deposit transactions for ERC20, and transfer for ERC721
- Updated frontend to require wallet connection and include `userWalletAddress` in purchase requests
- Buy Points modal now displays a clear, accurate breakdown:
  - Gross USD, Funding Rate Deduction, Net After Funding Rate, Estimated Gas Fee, User Receives
  - Dynamic gas estimation is used for all quotes
  - Points calculation is robust and always present

## Current State
- Buy Points modal successfully fetches supported assets and quotes
- Purchase step now prompts for wallet connection and sends correct transaction data to backend
- Backend returns real transaction objects for user to sign (no more mock calldata)
- User sees a transparent, itemized quote breakdown in the modal
- Points credited are always valid and non-negative

## Next Tasks
- Finalize NFT support in the Buy Points modal and backend
- Adopt this step-by-step modal pattern for the upcoming referral account menu and all account modals
- Add Playwright or manual test to demonstrate full working flow

## Changes to Plan
- None; all changes align with the refactor and collaboration protocols
- This modal pattern is now the standard for all account-related flows

## Open Questions
- Is there any edge case where wallet connection is skipped or fails silently?
- Should we add more robust error handling or user feedback for wallet connection issues?
- Do we need to support additional asset types or custom coins in the modal?
- Any additional requirements for NFT deposit/credit flows?
