# HANDOFF: 2025-05-06 - ComfyUI Service Refactor Complete, Workflows Next

## Work Completed

*   **Continued `comfyui.js` Refactoring:**
    *   **Step 7 (File Management):** Extracted `getUploadUrl`, `uploadFile` into `src/core/services/comfydeploy/fileManager.js`. Added wrappers in `comfyui.js`.
    *   **Step 8 (Duplicate Removal):** Removed unused `createDeployment` and `uploadWorkflow` methods from `comfyui.js`.
    *   **Step 9 (Run Management):** Extracted `submitRequest`, `checkStatus`, `getResults`, `cancelRequest` and helpers into `src/core/services/comfydeploy/runManager.js`. Added wrappers in `comfyui.js`.
    *   **Step 10 (Resource Fetching):** Extracted `getDeployments`, `getWorkflows`, `getMachines`, `getWorkflowVersion`, `getWorkflowDetails`, `getWorkflowContent` and helpers into `src/core/services/comfydeploy/resourceFetcher.js`. Added wrappers in `comfyui.js`.
*   **Fix API Authentication:** Modified `_makeApiRequest` in `comfyui.js` to correctly include the `Authorization` header, resolving 401 errors encountered after Step 10. Application functionality confirmed restored.
*   **Result:** Reduced `comfyui.js` from over 1000 lines to approximately 345 lines, significantly improving its clarity and focus as an interface layer.

## Current State

*   `src/core/services/comfydeploy/comfyui.js` is successfully refactored into smaller, focused modules (`config.js`, `fileManager.js`, `runManager.js`, `resourceFetcher.js`). It primarily acts as an orchestrator and maintains the public service API.
*   The application is functional after the latest changes and fixes.
*   `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflows.js` remains large (1115 lines) containing complex logic for initialization, fetching, caching, processing, and indexing workflows, despite previous extraction of utilities and actions.

## Next Tasks

*   **Refactor `workflows.js`:**
    1.  Create `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflowCacheManager.js`.
    2.  Migrate initialization logic (`initialize`), fetching helpers (`_fetch...`), processing helpers (`_process...`, `_parse...`), indexing (`_buildIndexes`), and cache management (`this.cache`, `_clearCache`, `_isCacheStale`, `_ensureInitialized`) from `workflows.js` to `workflowCacheManager.js`.
    3.  Update `workflows.js` to utilize the new `workflowCacheManager.js` for its initialization and data retrieval needs, further reducing its size and complexity.

## Changes to Plan

*   This refactoring effort continues the user-directed goal of breaking down large service files (`comfyui.js`, `workflows.js`) into more manageable modules, which deviates slightly from the original handoff's focus solely on log verbosity and cleanup but aligns with broader maintainability goals.

## Open Questions

*   None at this time.
