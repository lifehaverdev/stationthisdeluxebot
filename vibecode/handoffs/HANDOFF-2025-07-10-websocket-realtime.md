# HANDOFF: 2025-07-10

## Work Completed
- Implemented a real-time WebSocket delivery system for the web sandbox interface.
- Created a backend WebSocket server (`src/core/services/websocket/server.js`) for authenticated, per-user push notifications.
- Created a frontend WebSocket client (`src/core/services/websocket/client.js`) for live event subscription in the browser.
- Refactored codebase to use clear, centralized naming (`websocketServer`, `websocketClient`) and a single `src/core/services/websocket/` directory.
- Updated all backend and frontend imports to use the new structure.
- Integrated real-time progress and result delivery for both synchronous (OpenAI) and asynchronous (ComfyUI) tool executions.
- Updated the sandbox UI to display live progress and results for each tool window.
- Added a README to the websocket service directory for future contributors.

## Current State
- WebSocket server is initialized with the main HTTP server and manages user connections by JWT-authenticated masterAccountId.
- Backend services emit `generationProgress` and `generationUpdate` events to the correct user in real time.
- Frontend sandbox UI listens for these events and updates the UI for the relevant tool window.
- Codebase is organized, with no duplicate/confusing service files.

## Next Tasks
- Add more event types as needed (e.g., for notifications, errors, or other live updates).
- Expand UI to handle more output types (audio, video, etc.).
- Add Playwright or equivalent tests to demonstrate end-to-end real-time delivery.
- Document the event contract in more detail (types, payloads, error handling).

## Changes to Plan
- Consolidated all WebSocket logic into a single, top-level service directory for clarity and maintainability.
- Renamed all service variables and imports for unambiguous usage.

## Open Questions
- Should we add a generic event bus or pub/sub abstraction for future real-time features?
- Do we want to support multi-device or multi-tab session management for the same user?
- What is the preferred way to handle authentication refresh or reconnection edge cases?
