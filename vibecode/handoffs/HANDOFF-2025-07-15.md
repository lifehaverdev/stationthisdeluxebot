# HANDOFF: 2025-07-15

## Work Completed
- **Backend API Extension**: Extended the `/api/v1/user/dashboard` endpoint to include `referralVault` data, allowing the frontend to determine if a user already has a vault.
- **Frontend UI Integration**: 
    - Updated the `accountDropdown.js` component to conditionally show a "Set Up Referral Vault" button based on the new dashboard data.
    - Created the `ReferralVaultModal.js` and `referralVaultModal.css` files, scaffolding a multi-step UI for naming the vault, reviewing it, and seeing deployment status.
- **Vault Creation Backend**:
    - Built a new external API at `/api/v1/referral-vault` with endpoints to `check-name` availability and `create` a new vault.
    - Implemented a new internal `actionsApi.js` to orchestrate the complex, multi-step vault creation logic.
    - Added a (currently simulated) `deployReferralVault` method to `creditService.js` which is called by the `actionsApi`.
- **Refactoring & Debugging**:
    - Refactored CSRF token handling into a shared utility, `window.auth.ensureCsrfToken`, for use by multiple modals.
    - Diagnosed and fixed a series of backend errors:
        - `401 Unauthorized`: Resolved by adding the `authenticateUserOrApiKey` middleware to the new referral vault route.
        - `404 Not Found`: Corrected the internal API routing for the `actionsApi`.
        - `503 Service Unavailable`: Fixed a dependency injection issue, ensuring `creditService` and `saltMiningService` were correctly provided to the `actionsApi`.

## Current State
- The end-to-end user flow for requesting a referral vault is now functional.
- The frontend modal correctly communicates with the backend APIs.
- The backend successfully orchestrates the creation process, including checking for name uniqueness, fetching the user's wallet, mining a salt for the `0x1152` address prefix, and calling the deployment service.
- The system is stable and ready for the next phase of implementation, which involves moving from a simulated deployment to a real one.

## Next Tasks
- Replace the simulated `deployReferralVault` function in `creditService.js` with logic that either performs the on-chain transaction or queues it for an operator.
- Define and implement the operator-side function to finalize deployments.
- Enhance the `ReferralVaultModal` with more comprehensive error handling and user feedback for different failure scenarios (e.g., insufficient funds for gas).
- Create a Playwright test to provide a live demonstration of the complete, working user flow.

## Changes to Plan
- No significant deviations from the original plan. The architecture has been built out as anticipated, following existing patterns.

## Open Questions
- What are the precise requirements and security considerations for the operator-run deployment function?
- How should the system estimate and handle gas costs for the user?
- Should an administrative interface be created for operators to view and manage pending vault deployments?
