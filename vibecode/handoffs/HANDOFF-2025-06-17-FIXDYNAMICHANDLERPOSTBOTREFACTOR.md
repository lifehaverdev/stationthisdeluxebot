HANDOFF: 2025-06-17
Work Completed
We successfully debugged and repaired the entire dynamic workflow execution pipeline. This was a complex, multi-stage process that resolved a cascade of critical errors.
Fixed Generation Record Creation:
Implemented the correct creation flow for generation records in src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js.
Resolved a 400 Bad Request error by ensuring a User Session is created and its sessionId is included in the generation record.
Resolved a subsequent 400 Bad Request error by ensuring a User Event is created and its initiatingEventId is included.
Resolved a Deployment ID is required error by correctly passing the deploymentId from the tool's metadata through the comfyuiService.
Corrected Media Input Handling:
Rewrote the media handling logic in dynamicCommands.js to correctly process images from messages the user replies to, not just images sent with the command itself.
Simplified the getTelegramFileUrl logic to be more robust.
Resolved Duplicate Notifications:
Identified and fixed a race condition where the webhookProcessor and the generationOutputsApi were both emitting a generationUpdated event.
Removed the redundant event emission from webhookProcessor.js, making the API the single source of truth and eliminating double messages.
Addressed Initial output.text Delivery:
Modified telegramNotifier.js to correctly detect and fetch content from text file URLs provided in the webhook payload, enabling the delivery of text-based results.
Current State
The system is stable and fully functional. The core feature of executing a dynamic ComfyDeploy workflow via a Telegram command is working as intended.
The /tag command can be used by replying to an image, and it successfully returns the generated text tags to the user.
The end-to-end data flow (User -> Session -> Event -> Generation -> Job -> Webhook -> Notification) is correct and robust.
Next Tasks
Optimize Session Management: As identified during our work, the system currently creates a new session for every command. The next logical step would be to implement a "find-or-create" pattern for sessions to improve efficiency and enable contextual, multi-turn interactions.
Remove Debug Logging: The temporary diagnostic logs added to comfyui.js have been removed.
Changes to Plan
No changes were made to the high-level REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md. This effort was focused on critical bug fixing to align the system's behavior with its intended design.
Open Questions
Should the next priority be optimizing the session management, or should we move on to the next feature outlined in the Genius Plan?
