# HANDOFF: 2024-07-10

## Work Completed
- Investigated the workflow execution flow for the web platform (sandbox) and backend.
- Identified that workflow execution currently does **not** check user credit/points before submitting jobs to compute resources.
- Confirmed that points are only debited **after** job completion, via the webhook processor, which can result in resource abuse and poor user feedback.
- Outlined the security and resource implications of this gap.

## Current State
- Users can execute workflows even if they have no credit; jobs are submitted to compute resources regardless of user balance.
- If the user has no credit, the job is processed, but the result is marked as `payment_failed` after completion.
- There is no pre-execution block or user feedback for insufficient credit.

## Next Tasks
1. **Backend: Pre-Execution Credit Check**
   - In `generationExecutionApi.js`, before submitting a workflow job, estimate the cost and check the user's available credit/points.
   - If the user has insufficient credit, return an error and do not submit the job.
   - Ensure the check is robust for all workflow types (ComfyUI, OpenAI, etc.).
2. **Frontend: User Feedback**
   - Update the sandbox frontend to handle the new error response and display a clear message/modal if the user tries to execute a workflow without enough credit.
   - (Optional) Ensure the user's current credit/points are always visible in the UI.
3. **(Optional) Reservation System**
   - Consider reserving points at execution time and finalizing the deduction after job completion, with refund logic if the job fails.
4. **Testing & Demonstration**
   - Create Playwright or equivalent tests to demonstrate that users without credit cannot execute workflows.
   - Provide a working UI demonstration for user feedback on insufficient credit.

## Changes to Plan
- This is a critical security and resource protection fix, aligned with the projectâ€™s security and resource management goals.
- No deviation from the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN; this is a required patch for correct system operation.

## Open Questions
- What is the best way to estimate the cost of a workflow before execution (especially for variable-cost jobs)?
- Should we implement a reservation/hold system for points, or is a pre-check sufficient for now?
- How should we handle race conditions (e.g., two jobs submitted in parallel by the same user with just enough credit for one)?
