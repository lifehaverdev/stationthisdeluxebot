HANDOFF: 2024-07-11 â€” Sandbox Image Overlay Responsiveness
Work Completed
Refactored the image overlay/modal to be appended to <main class="sandbox-main"> for proper stacking and containment.
Updated the overlay/modal structure to match the style and layout of other modals (e.g., BuyPointsModal) for visual consistency.
Added a flexbox-based .image-overlay-img-container to center and constrain the image.
Improved overlay accessibility: Escape key closes the overlay, and clicking the background (not the image or close button) also closes it.
Ensured the close button is always visible and accessible.
Updated CSS to use max-width: 100% and max-height: 100% for the image, and set modal/container constraints.
Current State
Overlay/modal appears above the sandbox content and is visually consistent with other modals.
Overlay can be closed via Escape key, close button, or clicking the background.
The image is always centered within the modal.
However, the image is still rendering much larger than the modal/viewport in some environments, and is not being properly constrained to fit the screen. Only the top-left corner is visible in some cases.
Next Tasks
Debug and resolve the image scaling issue so that the image always fits within the modal and viewport, regardless of its original size or aspect ratio.
Consider using width: auto; height: auto; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; object-fit: contain; on the image and ensuring all parent containers have the correct constraints and overflow settings.
Test on multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior.
Optionally, add pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-pan for enhanced usability on large images.
Add a Playwright or equivalent UI test to demonstrate correct overlay/modal behavior.
Changes to Plan
No major deviations from the refactor or collaboration protocols; this work aligns with the current UI/UX improvement phase.
The persistent image scaling bug is now the top priority for the next iteration.
Open Questions
Should the overlay support advanced gestures (pinch-to-zoom, drag-to-pan) for large images?
Is there a preferred minimum/maximum modal size for very small or very large screens?
Should the overlay/modal be resizable or draggable for power users?

# Debug Log: Failed Attempts to Fix Image Overlay Scaling (2024-07-14)

## Persistent Problem
- The image overlay modal displays images at their natural size (e.g., 2048px wide) even when the parent container (.sandbox-main) is much smaller (e.g., 720px wide).
- The overlay and its children (modal, container, image) are not being constrained by the parent, causing overflow and unusable UI.
- Debug logs confirm: overlay parent is correct size, but overlay/modal/image are always as large as the image's natural size.

## Attempted Fixes (All Failed)
1. **CSS: max-width/max-height/width/height on overlay, modal, container, image**
   - Used combinations of `width: 100%`, `height: 100%`, `max-width: 100%`, `max-height: 100%`, `object-fit: contain` on all overlay/modal/image elements.
   - No effect: overlay and image still sized to image's natural size.
2. **CSS: Use vw/vh units**
   - Tried `max-width: 100vw`, `max-height: 100vh` on modal and overlay.
   - No effect: overlay still overflows parent.
3. **CSS: Use inset: 0 instead of top/left/width/height**
   - No effect.
4. **CSS: Add box-sizing: border-box everywhere**
   - No effect.
5. **CSS: Add min-width: 0; min-height: 0; to all overlay/modal/container**
   - No effect.
6. **JS: Add debug logs to print computed sizes of all overlay/modal/container/image elements and parent**
   - Confirmed parent is correct size, but overlay/modal/image are not constrained.
7. **CSS: Set .sandbox-main to position: relative; width: 100%; height: 100%;**
   - No effect.
8. **CSS: Remove all padding/margins from modal/container**
   - No effect.
9. **CSS: Set all overlay/modal/container to display: flex, flex: 1 1 auto, align-items/justify-content center**
   - No effect.

## Additional Attempted Fixes (2024-07-14, Continued)
10. **CSS: Aggressively set min-width: 0, min-height: 0, box-sizing: border-box, and flex-shrink: 1 on all overlay elements, including the image**
    - No effect: overlay and image still sized to image's natural size.
11. **CSS: Force overlay to width: 100%, height: 100%, max-width: 100%, max-height: 100%, overflow: hidden, and all four sides (left: 0; right: 0; top: 0; bottom: 0;)**
    - No effect: overlay and image still sized to image's natural size.
12. **CSS: Use position: fixed and viewport units (width: 100vw, height: 100vh) for overlay**
    - (To be tested, but not preferred for sandbox-contained overlays.)

## Summary of All Techniques Tried
- All standard and advanced CSS flexbox, box-sizing, and containment strategies have failed.
- The overlay and its children are still expanding to the image's natural width, not the parent container.

## Further Investigation Needed
- It is now likely that there is JavaScript or CSS elsewhere in the chain (possibly global styles, inline styles, or JS manipulation) that is interfering with the overlay's sizing.
- Next steps: Deeply inspect the DOM in the browser, check computed styles for all overlay and parent elements, and search for any JS that might be setting width/height or overriding styles at runtime.
- Consider searching the codebase for any JS that manipulates overlay/modal/image sizing, or for global CSS rules that could affect overlays or images.
