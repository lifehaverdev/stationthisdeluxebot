# HANDOFF: 2025-05-23 - Tweak/Rerun ComfyUI Dependency Issue - RESOLVED

## Work Completed

Numerous attempts were made to resolve an issue where the `ComfyUI` service dispatch fails within the `tweak_apply:` and `rerun_gen:` callback handlers in the Telegram bot (`src/platforms/telegram/bot.js`).
Diagnostic logging was added to trace the `dependencies` object at different stages. Multiple issues were identified and fixed sequentially:

1.  **Incorrect Dependency Destructuring (Telegram Bot):** Corrected destructuring in `createTelegramBot` in `src/platforms/telegram/bot.js` to ensure `comfyuiService` and other services were correctly assigned from the `dependencies` object.
2.  **Incorrect Dependency Destructuring (Telegram Index):** Corrected destructuring in `initializeTelegramPlatform` in `src/platforms/telegram/index.js` to use `services.comfyui` (lowercase 'c') as the source for `comfyuiService`.
3.  **Tool/Workflow ID Resolution:** Changed `workflowsService.getWorkflowById` to `workflowsService.getToolById` and updated `toolId` sourcing from `originalGeneration.metadata?.toolId` in `src/platforms/telegram/bot.js`. Added `getToolById` to `WorkflowsService` and updated `WorkflowCacheManager` to index tools by `toolId` in `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflows.js` and `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflowCacheManager.js`.
4.  **Missing `costRate` in Tweaked/Rerun Generations:** Ensured `costRate` from the original generation's metadata is copied to the new (tweaked/rerun) generation's metadata in `src/platforms/telegram/bot.js`. This resolved "Invalid costUsd format" errors during webhook processing.
5.  **Missing `notificationContext` in Tweaked/Rerun Generations:** Ensured `notificationContext` from the original generation's metadata is copied to the new (tweaked/rerun) generation's metadata in `src/platforms/telegram/bot.js`. This resolved "Missing metadata.notificationContext" errors in the `NotificationDispatcher`.

## Current State & Problem Description

**RESOLVED.**

The `tweak_apply:` and `rerun_gen:` functionalities in the Telegram bot are now working correctly. Tweaked and rerun generations are successfully dispatched to ComfyUI, processed, and notifications are delivered back to the user.

The primary issues stemmed from incorrect dependency injection leading to `undefined` services within callback scopes, and missing metadata fields (`costRate`, `notificationContext`) in new generations created by the tweak/rerun logic.

No longer necessary for this issue. The key files involved in the fix were:
*   `src/platforms/telegram/bot.js`
*   `src/platforms/telegram/index.js`
*   `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflows.js`
*   `src/core/services/comfydeploy/workflowCacheManager.js`
