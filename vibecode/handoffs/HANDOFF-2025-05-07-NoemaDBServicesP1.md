# HANDOFF: 2025-05-07 (Noema DB Services - Phase 1 Implementation)

## Work Completed

1.  **Noema Core Data Schemas Defined:**
    *   Created `vibecode/decisions/ADR-002-NoemaCoreDataSchemas.md` detailing the MongoDB schemas for all seven core `noema` collections: `userCore`, `userEconomy`, `userPreferences`, `transactions`, `userSessions`, `userEvents`, and `generationOutputs`.
2.  **Noema Event Catalog Initiated:**
    *   Created `vibecode/docs/NOEMA_EVENT_CATALOG.md` outlining the purpose, structure, and initial event type definitions for logging user and system activities to the `userEvents` collection.
3.  **Core Database Utilities Adapted for Noema:**
    *   The existing `db/utils/queue.js` (now `src/core/services/db/utils/queue.js`) has been adopted for `noema`, providing robust client caching and an operation queuing mechanism.
    *   The existing `db/models/BaseDB.js` (now `src/core/services/db/BaseDB.js`) has been adapted as the base class for `noema` database services. It uses the `noema` database name and integrates with `queue.js`.
4.  **`UserCoreDB` Service Implemented:**
    *   Created and implemented `src/core/services/db/userCoreDb.js`, which extends `BaseDB` and provides methods for interacting with the `userCore` collection.
5.  **Database Initialization Integrated:**
    *   Created `src/core/initDB.js` to manage the initial database connection using `getCachedClient` from `queue.js`.
    *   Integrated the `initializeDatabase()` call into `app.js` to ensure the database connection is established at application startup.
6.  **`UserCoreDB` Service Integrated and Tested:**
    *   Modified `src/core/services/db/index.js` to export `UserCoreDB` under the `noema` namespace, making it available as `services.db.noema.userCore`.
    *   Added a new Telegram command (`/noemainfome`) to `src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js`.
    *   This command successfully fetches and displays a user's `userCore` document from the `noema` database by their Telegram ID, using the integrated `UserCoreDB` service via the main `services` object.

## Current State

*   The foundational data infrastructure for `noema` (schemas, event catalog definitions, core DB utilities, and the `UserCoreDB` service) is designed and partially implemented.
*   The `UserCoreDB` service is functional and has been successfully tested end-to-end from a Telegram command through the application stack to the `noema` database.
*   The pattern for creating new Noema-specific database service files (extending `BaseDB`, using the queue, being exported via `services.db.noema.*`) is established.
*   The application correctly initializes the database connection to `noema` at startup.

## Next Tasks

1.  **Implement Remaining Noema DB Service Files:**
    *   Create the JavaScript service files for the remaining `noema` collections, following the pattern established by `UserCoreDB.js` (extending `BaseDB`, implementing necessary methods, and exporting an instance):
        *   `userSessionsDb.js`
        *   `userEventsDb.js`
        *   `generationOutputsDb.js`
        *   `userEconomyDb.js`
        *   `userPreferencesDb.js`
        *   `transactionsDb.js`
2.  **Integrate New DB Services into `services.db.noema`:**
    *   As each new DB service file is created, import and export it from `src/core/services/db/index.js` under the `noema` namespace.
3.  **Integrate Usage of Noema DB Services into Application Logic:**
    *   Begin incrementally updating relevant parts of the application (Telegram, Discord, Web, API platforms, and core services) to *use* the new Noema DB services for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
    *   **Priority Examples:**
        *   **Event Logging:** Start logging key user actions (e.g., command usage, logins, generation requests) to the `userEvents` collection using `UserEventsDB` (once created).
        *   **Session Management:** Implement session creation, update, and termination logic using `UserSessionsDB` (once created) at appropriate points (e.g., user login, logout, activity timeouts).
4.  **Data Analytics Planning & Implementation:**
    *   Based on the new Noema data structures and the `NOEMA_EVENT_CATALOG.md`, begin planning and implementing data analytics queries and potentially dashboards to derive insights from the collected data.

## Changes to Plan

*   The initial plan to move directly to Phase 2 (Onboarding Flow Design) after schema definition was deferred.
*   Instead, per user direction, the focus shifted to implementing the database service layer for `noema` and integrating it into the existing application structure, starting with `UserCoreDB` and a Telegram test command.
*   This provides a concrete, working foundation before building higher-level features that depend on this data layer.

## Open Questions

*   What is the priority for implementing the remaining Noema DB service files (from list in Next Tasks #1)?
*   Which specific application feature or platform should be the first target for integrating the *creation/writing* of data into the new Noema collections (e.g., should we prioritize logging login events via `UserEventsDB` first, or creating sessions via `UserSessionsDB`) across all platforms or one specific platform as a pilot?
*   Are there any immediate, high-priority analytics or reports that need to be generated once data starts populating the new `noema` collections?
