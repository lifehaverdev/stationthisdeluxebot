# HANDOFF: 2025-06-25

## Work Completed

- **Implemented "Magic Amount" Wallet Linking:** We have fully implemented the backend infrastructure for linking user wallets via a unique "magic amount" deposit, as outlined in `ADR-009-ONCHAIN-CREDIT-VAULT.md`. This provides a secure, gasless (for the user) linking method for non-browser platforms like Telegram.

- **New Database Service:** Created `WalletLinkingRequestDB` to persistently store, track, and expire magic amount requests. This ensures that the linking process is robust and can survive application restarts.

- **New Internal API Endpoint:** Added a new endpoint, `POST /internal/v1/users/:masterAccountId/wallets/requests/magic-amount`. This allows client-facing platforms to programmatically request a unique magic amount for a user.

- **Enhanced `CreditService`:** The `CreditService` has been updated to check every incoming deposit against pending magic amount requests *before* processing it for credit.

- **New `WalletLinkingService`:** Logic was refactored into a dedicated `WalletLinkingService`. When a magic amount deposit is detected, this service now handles the final steps of linking the wallet to the user's account and completing the request.

## Current State

- The backend system is feature-complete for magic amount wallet linking.
- The system can successfully generate a unique request, detect the corresponding on-chain transaction, and securely associate the new wallet with the correct user account.
- The system is now ready to be integrated with a client-facing platform adapter (e.g., Telegram).

## Next Tasks

- **Client-Side Integration:** The primary next step is for a platform adapter (e.g., `telegram/bot.js`) to be updated to use this new functionality.
- **Implement User Flow:** The adapter needs a new command or flow that:
    1.  Calls the new API endpoint to get a magic amount and token address.
    2.  Presents this information clearly to the user.
    3.  Instructs them to send the *exact* magic amount to the application's vault address.

## Changes to Plan

- No deviations from the high-level plan. This work directly implements a required component described in the on-chain credit ADR.

## Open Questions

- What is the ideal user experience for instructing a user to make a specific on-chain transaction from within a chat interface?
- How should the system handle edge cases, such as a user sending the wrong amount or the request expiring before the deposit is made?
