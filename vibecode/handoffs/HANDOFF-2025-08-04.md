# HANDOFF: 2025-08-04

## Work Completed

This session focused on implementing the "Schema Simplification & Public Execution Flow" as defined in the ADR from 2025-08-04.

1.  **Schema Migration**:
    *   A new migration script (`scripts/migrations/2025_08_schema_simplification.js`) was created to refactor the `spells` collection.
    *   This script removes legacy fields (`slug`, `publicSlug`, `visibility`, `permissionType`), renames cached analytics fields to `estimatedRuntimeMs` and `estimatedCostPts`, and enforces a unique index on the `name` field.

2.  **Database Service Refactor (`spellsDb.js`)**:
    *   The `spellsDb` service was updated to work exclusively with the new canonical schema.
    *   `createSpell` now computes and persists `estimatedRuntimeMs` and `estimatedCostPts` upon creation.
    *   `updateSpell` now prevents a spell from being made public if it lacks cost and runtime estimates.

3.  **API Endpoint Updates**:
    *   The internal and external `spellsApi.js` files were updated to align with the new schema. Spells are now primarily identified and fetched by their `name`.
    *   The `/quote` endpoint has been deprecated, as cost estimates are now included in the main spell object.
    *   The `/spells/cast` endpoint now requires a `creditTxId` parameter, decoupling the execution request from the payment itself.

4.  **Flexible Payment & Authentication Flow**:
    *   A new `/payments/prepare-spell` endpoint was added to the internal `pointsApi.js`. This endpoint checks a user's balance against a spell's estimated cost and, if sufficient, deducts the points and returns a `creditTxId`.
    *   A new `flexibleCastAuth` middleware was created for the external `/spells/cast` endpoint. This allows the endpoint to be authenticated via one of three methods:
        1.  **API Key**: For developer access.
        2.  **JWT Session**: For signed-in application users.
        3.  **`creditTxId`**: For guest users who have pre-paid for a single execution.
    *   An internal `/credits/validate-tx` endpoint was added to securely validate `creditTxId`s provided by guest users.

## Current State

The backend infrastructure for the new public spell execution flow is largely complete. The database schema is simplified, and the APIs have been updated to support the new data model and payment flow.

However, an error was detected when saving a new spell through the UI, which is currently under investigation. The error appears to be an internal server error (500) originating from the `POST /internal/v1/data/spells` endpoint.
