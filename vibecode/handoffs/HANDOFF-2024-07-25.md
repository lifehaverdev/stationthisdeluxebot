# HANDOFF: 2024-07-25

## Work Completed

*   **Core Architecture**: Defined a two-service architecture in `ADR-009` and `ADR-010`, separating blockchain interaction (`EthereumService`) from business logic (`CreditService`). This established clear responsibilities and a plan for a robust, event-driven system.
*   **Database Layer**: Designed and implemented the `credit_ledger` and `system_state` database schemas using `tingodb`. This provides an auditable trail for all credit-related activities and persists the application's on-chain processing state.
*   **Risk Management & Support Services**:
    *   **`PriceFeedService`**: Built a service to fetch real-time token prices from Alchemy's API, successfully tested with native (ETH) and ERC20 tokens.
    *   **`DexService`**: Created a service to interact with Uniswap V3's `QuoterV2` contract for on-chain liquidity assessment, including a multi-network address management system.
    *   **`TokenRiskEngine`**: Implemented a risk engine that synthesizes data from the `PriceFeedService` and `DexService` to evaluate the viability of collateral.
*   **Validation**: Created standalone test scripts (`test-service.js`, `test-price-feed.js`, `test-risk-engine.js`) to validate each component of the service stack, confirming connectivity to Sepolia, contract data decoding, price fetching, and risk simulation.

## Current State

*   The foundational services for interacting with Ethereum and assessing token risk are built and individually tested.
*   The `CreditService` exists as a scaffold but does not yet contain the primary business logic for handling deposits or managing the credit lifecycle.
*   The system is capable of reading from the blockchain, fetching prices, and simulating trades, but it does not yet react to on-chain events automatically.
*   We have not yet integrated the full end-to-end flow from event detection to database logging.

## Next Tasks

As per your direction, the immediate focus is implementing the **Startup Reconciliation Flow** within the `CreditService`.

1.  **Database Reset**: On application startup, clear the `credit_ledger` collection to ensure a clean state for testing.
2.  **Reconciliation Logic**:
    *   Read the `lastProcessedBlock` from the `system_state` database. If it doesn't exist, use the contract's deployment block number.
    *   Query the `CreditVault` contract for all `Deposit` events from the `lastProcessedBlock` to the current `latest` block.
    *   Iterate through the missed events. For each event (starting with ETH deposits):
        *   Use the `PriceFeedService` to determine the USD value of the deposited asset at the time of the deposit (or current time, TBD).
        *   Create a corresponding entry in the `credit_ledger` database.
    *   Update the `lastProcessedBlock` in the `system_state` database to the block number of the last processed event.
3.  **Live Webhook Handler**: After reconciliation is complete, the application will need to process live events from the Alchemy webhook. This logic will be very similar to the reconciliation logic but will handle single events in real-time.

## Changes to Plan

No major changes to the overall plan outlined in `ADR-009` and `ADR-010`. We are now moving from building foundational services to implementing the core application business logic on top of them.

## Open Questions

*   **Contract ABI & Address**: To implement the reconciliation, we need the final ABI and deployed Sepolia address for the `CreditVault` smart contract.
*   **Event Signature**: What is the exact event signature (name and parameters) for a user deposit? e.g., `Deposit(address indexed user, address indexed token, uint256 amount)`.
*   **Historical Pricing**: For reconciliation, should we use the price at the time of the missed deposit, or the price at the time of reconciliation? Using the historical price is more accurate but may require a different API endpoint or logic. For now, we will proceed with the current price for simplicity.
