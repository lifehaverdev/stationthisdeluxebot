# HANDOFF: 2025-06-16 - Spell Execution Workflow & Webhook Processing Restoration

## Work Completed

This session involved a deep, end-to-end debugging and restoration of the asynchronous workflow execution system, which is driven by ComfyDeploy webhooks. The core `animewrite` spell is now fully functional.

**Key Achievements:**

1.  **Webhook Processor Dependency Injection Fixed**:
    *   Corrected the dependency injection in `src/platforms/web/routes/index.js` to pass `services.internal.client` to the `webhookProcessor`, resolving the initial "internalApiClient is undefined" errors.

2.  **Environment Variable & API Key Authentication Repaired**:
    *   Ensured `dotenv` is loaded at the application entry point (`app.js`) so all services receive environment variables correctly.
    *   Replaced the hardcoded, non-existent `INTERNAL_API_KEY_GENERAL` in `webhookProcessor.js` with the correct `INTERNAL_API_KEY_WEB`, fixing the `401 Unauthorized` errors.

3.  **Spell Workflow Logic Corrected**:
    *   **Stopped Premature Costing**: Modified `webhookProcessor.js` to recognize intermediate spell steps (`deliveryStrategy: 'spell_step'`) and bypass all costing and debiting logic, allowing the workflow to continue instead of ending after step one.
    *   **Enabled the Dispatcher**: Fixed a critical bug in `app.js` where the `NotificationDispatcher` was never started due to an incorrect dependency check (`services.internalApiClient` vs. `services.internal.client`).
    *   **Fixed Dispatcher API Calls**: Corrected all API call paths in `notificationDispatcher.js` to include the required `/internal` prefix, resolving the `404 Not Found` errors that were crashing the spell continuation process.
    *   **Repaired Final Notification Context**: Fixed `WorkflowExecutionService.js` to correctly populate the final `notificationContext` with the `chatId` and `messageId` from the `originalContext.telegramContext`, which was the final blocker preventing successful delivery.
    *   **Standardized Prompt Parameter**: Added logic to `WorkflowExecutionService.js` to normalize the user's `prompt` to the expected `input_prompt`, ensuring it's correctly passed through all spell steps and services.

4.  **Multi-Media Output Delivery Implemented**:
    *   Enhanced `src/platforms/telegram/utils/messaging.js` with new helper functions: `sendAnimationWithEscapedCaption` and `sendVideoWithEscapedCaption`.
    *   Overhauled `telegramNotifier.js` to loop through the entire `responsePayload`, identify all media types (images, videos), and send each one individually to the user, ensuring no outputs are missed.

## Current State

*   **Spell Execution is Fully Functional**: The entire asynchronous workflow is operational. Spells with multiple steps now execute from start to finish.
*   **Webhooks are Stable**: Webhooks are correctly received, authenticated, processed, and drive the workflow as intended.
*   **Complete Output Delivery**: The system now correctly delivers all media outputs (images, videos, text) from a completed workflow to the user on Telegram.
*   The system is stable and ready for further testing and feature development.

## Next Tasks

1.  **Full Regression Test**: Perform a thorough test of other spells and Telegram features to ensure these deep fixes have not introduced any new bugs.
2.  **Cleanup**: Remove any temporary `console.log` or `logger.info` statements that were added for debugging purposes during this session.
3.  **Review Other Service API Calls**: A pattern of missing `/internal` prefixes was found. Other, older services might suffer from the same issue and would benefit from a quick review.

## Open Questions

*   The current logic in `telegramNotifier.js` sends all media and then sends all text in a separate message. Is this the desired user experience, or should captions be attached to specific media items where possible?
*   Are there other complex spells with different output structures that should be tested to ensure the new multi-media notifier can handle them?
