# Refactor Status Summary (2025-04-21)

## Current Phase
**Phase 3: Workflow and Interaction Refactoring** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Recent Accomplishments
- âœ… Completed platform-agnostic command framework in `src/core/command/`
- âœ… Implemented webhook system for service integration
- âœ… Created workflow state machine with immutable transitions
- âœ… Built comprehensive validation framework
- âœ… Designed UI component system with platform-specific renderers
- âœ… Successfully migrated `/make` command with full E2E testing

## Next Uncompleted Task
**Command Migration: Media and Account Commands**
- Media commands are partially migrated with insufficient test coverage
- Account commands need comprehensive tests for account management, settings, and preferences
- These migrations are high-priority blockers for Phase 4 readiness

## Key Context
This task is critical because:
1. Phase 4 (Legacy Command Migration) depends on completing these migrations
2. Current test coverage for services is only at 30%
3. The `/make` command has been successfully migrated with a pattern that can be followed
4. Feature flags are in place for gradual rollout of new implementations

## Blockers for Phase 4
The following items must be addressed before progressing to Phase 4:
1. Test coverage for account and media commands
2. Service layer test coverage (currently only 30%)
3. UI component integration with workflows
4. Standardized test organization

## Success Criteria
- Complete test coverage of command implementations
- 80%+ test coverage for all key services
- Test coverage for all critical user workflows
- All tests follow consistent location and naming patterns
