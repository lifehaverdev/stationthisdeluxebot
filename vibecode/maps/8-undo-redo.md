# Undo/Redo Feature

## Purpose
Allow users to undo and redo actions in the sandbox node editor, improving usability and error recovery.

## Step 1: Codebase Audit

- [ ] List all files and functions related to workspace state, action history, and UI controls.
- [ ] Document current state of undo/redo (if any).
- [ ] Identify any blockers or architectural constraints.

## Step 2: Design

- [ ] Define data structures for action history and state snapshots.
- [ ] UI/UX sketches for undo/redo controls and feedback.
- [ ] Error handling (irreversible actions, memory usage).

## Step 3: Implementation

- [ ] Implement action history tracking and state restoration.
- [ ] Implement undo/redo UI controls.
- [ ] Integrate with workspace state changes.

## Step 4: Demo & Handoff

- [ ] Create a Playwright or screen recording demo.
- [ ] Update master plan and handoff doc.
