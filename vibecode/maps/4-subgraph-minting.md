# Subgraph Selection & Minting Feature

## Purpose
Enable users to select a group of connected nodes (subgraph) and mint/save them as a reusable spell in the sandbox editor.

## Step 1: Codebase Audit

- [ ] List all files and functions related to node selection, subgraph logic, and spell minting.
- [ ] Document current state of selection and minting UI.
- [ ] Identify any blockers or architectural constraints.

## Step 2: Design

- [ ] Define data structures for subgraph selection and spell metadata.
- [ ] UI/UX sketches for selection, minting, and metadata entry.
- [ ] Error handling (invalid subgraphs, incomplete metadata).

## Step 3: Implementation

- [ ] Implement multi-select and subgraph selection logic.
- [ ] Implement "mint as spell" UI and backend integration.
- [ ] Update state management for spells.

## Step 4: Demo & Handoff

- [ ] Create a Playwright or screen recording demo.
- [ ] Update master plan and handoff doc.
