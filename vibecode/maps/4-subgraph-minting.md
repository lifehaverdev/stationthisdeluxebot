## Codebase Audit Findings (2024-07-09)

### 1. Node Selection & Subgraph Logic
- **Node Representation & State:**
  - Nodes are represented as "tool windows" (`toolWindow.js`), each with a unique ID, position, tool definition, and parameter mappings.
  - Connections between nodes are managed via parameter mappings, where a parameter can be mapped to the output of another node.
- **Connection Management:**
  - Connection creation, validation, and management are handled in `connections/interaction.js`, `connections/manager.js`, and `connections/validation.js`.
  - The function `getNodeExecutionOrder` in `toolWindow.js` traverses dependencies, which is similar to subgraph traversal.
- **Selection UI:**
  - There is currently no explicit multi-select or subgraph selection UI. Node selection is implicit via interactions (e.g., clicking, dragging, connecting).

### 2. Spell Minting & Spells Menu
- **SpellsMenuModal (`components/SpellsMenuModal.js`):**
  - Handles the UI for creating, editing, and listing spells.
  - Spells have metadata (name, description) and a list of steps (nodes/tools).
  - Spell creation currently appears to be manual (form-based), not via subgraph selection.
- **Spell Saving:**
  - Spells are saved via API calls (`/api/v1/spells/`), with CSRF protection.
  - There is logic for checking duplicate names and updating spell metadata.

### 3. Architectural Constraints & Opportunities
- **State Management:**
  - All node and connection state is managed in a central state module (`state.js`), which is imported throughout the sandbox code.
- **Extensibility:**
  - The modular structure (nodes, connections, spells) is conducive to adding subgraph selection and minting.
- **Blockers:**
  - No existing multi-select or subgraph selection logic.
  - No direct way to "mint" a selected subgraph as a spell from the editor UI.

### Next Steps
1. **Design & Implement Subgraph Selection:**
   - Add UI for multi-selecting nodes (e.g., shift+click, lasso, or context menu).
   - Implement logic to extract the subgraph (selected nodes + their connections).
2. **Integrate with Spell Minting:**
   - Add a "Mint as Spell" action for the selected subgraph.
   - Pre-fill the spell creation modal with the subgraph's nodes and connections.
3. **Update State & API:**
   - Ensure the selected subgraph can be serialized and sent to the backend as a new spell.

### Progress Update (2024-07-19)

- **Multi-select and lasso selection are fully implemented:**
  - Desktop: Figma-style controls (pan with spacebar/middle mouse, lasso with left mouse, shift+click for multi-select).
  - Mobile: Tap toggles selection (multi-select by default, no lasso).
  - Selection state is robust and visually clear.
- **Spell Minting from Multi-Selection is now working:**
  - Users can select 2+ nodes, click the "Mint as Spell" FAB, and open the spell creation modal.
  - The modal is pre-filled with the selected nodes and connections.
  - **Users can now select which node parameters to expose as spell inputs** (e.g., prompt fields for LLM nodes).
  - Spell is saved and appears in the user's spell list.
- **Spell Node UX in Sandbox Canvas:**
  - Spells can be added to the canvas just like tools, with a unique spell node UI.
  - Exposed inputs are displayed and editable, just like tool parameters.
  - "Show More" reveals spell description, step list, and an "Explode" button.
  - "Explode" unpacks the spell into its original tool windows and connections, fully editable.
  - Spells can be executed directly from the canvas, using the exposed inputs.

---

### Next Steps (as of 2024-07-19)

1. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Test the full spell lifecycle: mint, add to canvas, edit inputs, explode, execute.
   - Test edge cases (missing tool definitions, invalid subgraphs, connected exposed inputs, etc).
   - Validate error handling and user feedback.
2. **Polish & Documentation:**
   - Refine UI/UX based on feedback.
   - Update documentation and handoff materials to reflect the new spell node system.

## Spell Minting UX Plan (2024-07-09)

- **Trigger:**
  - When 2 or more nodes are selected, a floating "Mint as Spell" action button appears near the selection or at a fixed location.
- **Action:**
  - Clicking the button serializes the selected subgraph (nodes + connections/parameter mappings).
  - Opens the SpellsMenuModal in "Create" mode.
- **SpellsMenuModal (Create Mode):**
  - Pre-fills the spell creation form with:
    - Steps: List of selected nodes (with display names)
    - (Optional) Visual summary of the subgraph
    - Name: (empty, user must enter)
    - Description: (empty, user must enter)
  - User can:
    - Enter name/description
    - Review steps (see which nodes are included)
    - Define Spell Inputs: Select which unconnected input parameters from the included nodes will be exposed as inputs for the entire spell.
    - (Optional) Remove/reorder steps before saving
    - Save the spell
- **Validation:**
  - (Optional) Validate subgraph before allowing minting (e.g., all required parameters mapped, no cycles)
- **Result:**
  - Spell is saved and appears in the user's spell list.

## Implementation Plan: Mint as Spell (2024-07-09)

1. **Floating Action Button (FAB) Logic**
   - Show FAB only when 2+ nodes are selected.
   - Add to main sandbox UI (`index.js`).
   - Listen for selection changes to show/hide FAB.

2. **Subgraph Serialization**
   - Utility function in `state.js` or new `subgraph.js`.
   - Gather selected node IDs, connections, and parameter mappings.
   - Return a serializable subgraph object.

3. **FAB Click Handler**
   - On click, serialize the current selection as a subgraph.
   - Open `SpellsMenuModal` in "Create" mode, passing the subgraph as initial data.

4. **SpellsMenuModal Integration**
   - Update `SpellsMenuModal` to accept an optional initial subgraph.
   - Pre-fill steps list with selected nodes.
   - Add UI for selecting which node parameters to expose as spell inputs.
   - (Optional) Show a visual summary of the subgraph.

5. **Save Spell**
   - On save, send the subgraph (nodes, connections, metadata, and exposed inputs) to the backend.

6. **(Optional) Validation**
   - Validate subgraph before allowing minting (e.g., all required parameters mapped, no cycles).

**Recommended Order:**
1. Implement FAB and show/hide logic.
2. Write subgraph serialization utility.
3. Wire up FAB click to modal with pre-filled data.
4. Integrate with backend save.

**Integration Points:**
- Selection state: `state.js`
- FAB UI: `index.js`
- Subgraph extraction: `state.js` or new file
- Modal: `SpellsMenuModal.js`
- API: Spell creation endpoint

## [RESOLVED] Blocker: Mint as Spell FAB Disappears After Lasso Selection (2024-07-19)

### Issue Summary
The "Mint as Spell" FAB would disappear after lasso selection because the selection state was being cleared by a race condition between the lasso `mouseup` event and a subsequent background `click` event. A `setTimeout` call to `clearSelection()` in the lasso logic was the primary cause.

### Resolution (2024-07-19)
- **Fix Implemented:** The `setTimeout(() => clearSelection(), 0)` in the lasso's `mouseup` handler in `src/platforms/web/client/src/sandbox/index.js` was replaced with a direct, synchronous call to `clearSelection()`.
- **Outcome:** This resolves the race condition. The previous selection is now cleared *before* the new lasso selection is established. The existing click-suppression logic now correctly prevents the background click from clearing the new selection.
- **Status:** The blocker is resolved. Lasso selection works as expected on desktop, and the "Mint as Spell" FAB persists correctly.

### Next Steps
- Continue with the implementation of the "Mint as Spell" feature as outlined in the implementation plan.

### Progress Update (2025-07-21)

- **Spell execution pipeline unblocked:** fixed missing `spellsService` injection and corrected internal API pathing so `/internal/v1/data/spells/cast` now resolves.
- **Tool resolution hardening:** WorkflowExecutionService now falls back to global ToolRegistry; OpenAI tools like `chatgpt-free` are recognised inside spells.
- **Prompt aliasing:** keep original `prompt` while adding `input_prompt` to satisfy both legacy and new tools.
- **Session handling fixed:** replaced invalid `/sessions/active` route with query-filtered `/sessions` lookup; auto-creates session when none exist.
- **Event logging:** events now carry valid `sessionId`; 400 errors eliminated.
- **First spell step executes successfully** (ChatGPT). Remaining work: ensure multi-step continuation and output wiring. 

### Progress Update (2025-07-22)

- **Spell execution now proceeds through step chain** thanks to centralized generation updates – ✅
- **Step parameter UI implemented** in the Spell Window “Show More” panel – ✅
- **Explode Spell** now instantiates underlying tool windows, restores their parameter mappings, recreates all connections, and removes the original spell node – ✅

Next focus: verify execution of exploded nodes end-to-end and continue polishing error states (missing definitions, invalid subgraphs, connected exposed inputs).
