# Visual Cues for Parallelism & Data Flow Feature

## Purpose
Provide clear visual indicators for parallel/serial execution and data flow between nodes in the sandbox editor.

## Step 1: Codebase Audit

- [ ] List all files and functions related to connection rendering, node execution, and UI styling.
- [ ] Document current state of visual cues (if any).
- [ ] Identify any blockers or architectural constraints.

## Step 2: Design

- [ ] Define visual styles for parallel/serial connections and data flow.
- [ ] UI/UX sketches for indicators (colors, arrows, badges, etc.).
- [ ] Error handling (ambiguous flows, overlapping cues).

## Step 3: Implementation

- [ ] Update connection rendering to show visual cues.
- [ ] Update node UI to indicate execution mode.
- [ ] Update legend or help UI for user guidance.

## Step 4: Demo & Handoff

- [ ] Create a Playwright or screen recording demo.
- [ ] Update master plan and handoff doc.
