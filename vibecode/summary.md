We're continuing to build StationThis, a real-time, creative, cross-platform AI assistant. Our development is iterative and demonstration-first, prioritizing user-visible features and practical, working solutions over perfect abstractions. All collaboration follows the `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`, which emphasizes user supervision and storing all artifacts in the `/vibecode/` directory.

The system is built on a layered architecture: Core Services, Platform-Agnostic Logic, and Platform Adapters, all connected via a comprehensive internal API layer.

A critical architectural decision (ADR-003) has been fully implemented: all access to core data collections now happens exclusively through a dedicated RESTful Internal API layer. This centralizes data access logic, enhances security, and ensures consistency across every platform adapter (Telegram, Web, etc.). Any direct database calls are considered legacy and should be refactored.

We've established a unified `ToolDefinition` format and a central `ToolRegistry` (ADR-004). This system is the source of truth for defining all tools, from ComfyUI workflows to external API calls. Each definition includes a structured schema for inputs, cost models, and platform-specific hints, powering dynamic command generation and settings menus.

To make tool execution more robust, a unified strategy is live (ADR-011). Each `ToolDefinition` now includes an `executionStrategy` field (e.g., 'sync', 'webhook', 'poll'). A central `WorkflowExecutionService` reads this strategy and manages the tool's lifecycle, completely decoupling platform adapters from the complexities of how a tool completes its work.

Our on-chain finance system has been significantly upgraded. The `CreditService` (ADR-009) was refactored to use an intelligent group-based confirmation logic. It now reads a user's total pending deposit balance directly from the smart contract, processing all their deposits in a single, gas-efficient transaction. This makes the system more robust and perfectly aligned with the on-chain state of truth.

The Telegram user experience has seen key enhancements. The main `bot.js` file has been refactored (ADR-012) into a scalable dispatcher pattern, where feature-specific managers now register their own handlers, preventing a monolithic and unmanageable file. We've also centralized messaging logic (ADR-013) to automatically handle Markdown escaping, resolving a common source of API errors.

Looking ahead, the next major sprint revolves around introducing Team-based infrastructure and a Job system for creating multi-step toolchains, as detailed in `jobs-teams-sprint-plan.md`. This is a significant effort that will involve new services like `TeamService` (for shared economy) and `JobOrchestrator`. It also requires updating the debit logic to support a user vs. team execution context. To support this, the `ToolDefinition` will be enhanced with a structured `outputSchema` to allow the output of one step to be reliably mapped as the input to another. This will require new database collections for `teams` and `jobRecords`.

This summary provides a snapshot of our current system state and development trajectory.
