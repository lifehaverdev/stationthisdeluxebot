We're continuing to build StationThis, a real-time, creative, cross-platform AI assistant. Our development is iterative and demonstration-first, prioritizing user-visible features and practical, working solutions. The long-term vision is a multi-platform web application, and all collaboration follows the `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`, which emphasizes user supervision and storing artifacts in `/vibecode/`.

The system is built on a layered architecture: Core Services, Platform-Agnostic Logic, Platform Adapters, a comprehensive API Layer, and Entry Points.

A critical architectural decision (ADR-003) has been fully implemented: all access to the seven core Noema database collections (like User Core, Economy, and Generation Outputs) now happens exclusively through a dedicated RESTful Internal API layer. This centralizes all data access logic, enhances security, and ensures consistency across every platform adapter (Telegram, Web, etc.).

We've established a unified `ToolDefinition` format and a central `ToolRegistry` (ADR-004). This system is the source of truth for defining all tools, such as ComfyUI workflows or external API calls. Each definition includes a structured schema for inputs, cost models, and platform-specific hints. This registry powers dynamic command generation, settings menus, and cost tracking.

To make tool execution more robust and scalable, a unified execution strategy has been designed (ADR-011). The `ToolDefinition` will include an `executionStrategy` field (e.g., 'sync', 'webhook', 'poll'), and a central `WorkflowExecutionService` will manage the lifecycle of any tool run, decoupling the platform adapters from the complexities of how a tool completes its work.

A standardized debit accounting system is live (ADR-005). When a generation is successfully completed, the `webhookProcessor.js` calculates the final `costUsd` and triggers a debit from the user's `usdCredit` balance via the internal economy API. This ensures all work is paid for and logged in the `transactions` collection.

User settings management has been significantly improved (ADR-006). A dedicated `UserSettingsService` allows users to customize default parameters for each tool. On Telegram, a multi-level inline keyboard menu for `/settings` is active (ADR-007), allowing users to browse their tools, view descriptions, and edit parameters directly.

The Telegram user experience has seen several key enhancements. The generation delivery menu (ADR-008) now offers options to rate a generation, hide the menu, view detailed parameters, tweak settings (which opens a pre-filled settings menu), and rerun the generation with a new random seed. The main `bot.js` file has been refactored (ADR-012) into a scalable dispatcher pattern, where feature managers register their own handlers, preventing a monolithic and unmanageable file. We've also centralized messaging logic to automatically handle Markdown escaping, resolving a common source of API errors (ADR-013).

Recent architectural work has introduced plans for on-chain finance. ADR-009 and ADR-010 outline the creation of an `EthereumService` for low-level blockchain interaction and a `CreditService` to manage user credits via an Ethereum smart contract, moving towards a decentralized balance system.

Looking ahead, the next major sprint revolves around introducing Team-based infrastructure and a Job system for creating multi-step toolchains (`jobs-teams-sprint-plan.md`). This is a significant effort that will involve new services like `TeamService` and `JobOrchestrator`, new database schemas for `teams` and `jobRecords`, and updating the debit logic to support a user vs. team execution context. To support this, the `ToolDefinition` will also be enhanced with a structured `outputSchema` to allow the output of one step to be reliably mapped as the input to another.

A few things to note for upcoming work: we still need to implement the mechanism for fetching a user's "most frequently used tools" for the Telegram `/settings` menu. We also need to continue refactoring any remaining direct database calls to use the new internal API endpoints, ensuring full compliance with our architectural standard.

This summary provides a snapshot of our current system state and development trajectory.
