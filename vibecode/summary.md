Hey team, here's a quick update on where we are with the StationThis refactor and current development efforts.

We're continuing to build out StationThis as a real-time, creative, cross-platform AI assistant. Our core vision, outlined in REFACTOR_NORTH_STAR.md, is a system allowing users to spend crypto-purchased points for AI generation (images, video, audio via ComfyUI, Vidu, Tripo, 11Labs), model training, and more. The user experience is the primary driver, with a "demonstration-first" approach: features must work visibly. The web interface, for instance, is envisioned as an interactive canvas-based workspace.

Architecturally (REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md), we're establishing a layered system: Core Services (`src/core/services/` like `comfyui.js`, `points.js`), Platform-Agnostic Logic (`src/workflows/` like `makeImage.js`), Platform Adapters (`src/platforms/telegram/`, `discord/`, `web/`, each with `commands/`, `renderer.js`, `bot.js` or `app.js`), an API Layer (`src/api/internal/`, `src/api/external/`), and main entry points (`src/index.js`, `server.js`). A key principle is boundary enforcement â€“ services must not import from platforms, for example.

A major milestone has been the full implementation and testing (see `scripts/test_internal_api.sh`) of our new Noema database backend and its dedicated Internal API layer, as per ADR-003. This API is now the sole gateway for all interactions with Noema collections (`userCore`, `userSessions`, `userEvents`, `userEconomy`, `userPreferences`, `transactions`, `generationOutputs`), whose schemas are detailed in ADR-002. This centralizes data logic, enhances security, and ensures consistency across platforms. All internal API services (`userCoreApi.js`, `userSessionsApi.js`, etc.) are live. The DB services themselves have also been refactored for proper logger injection.

The standardized debit accounting system (ADR-005) is now fully operational for ComfyUI generations initiated via Telegram. The `webhookProcessor.js` calculates `costUsd` from `generationRecord.metadata.costRate` and run duration, then calls the internal debit API. If successful, it also updates user EXP (based on `costUsd`); if debit fails, the generation record is marked `payment_failed`, and the product isn't delivered. This ensures monetization integrity. The legacy `PointsService.js` still needs refactoring to use this `usdCredit`-based system. For now, comprehensive cost accounting beyond specific generation costs is deferred (ADR-001 Cost Accounting Deferral).

We've formalized our "tools" via ADR-004, defining a `ToolDefinition` schema and a central `ToolRegistry` service. This registry, which sources tool details including inputs, costs, and ComfyUI Note node-parsed descriptions, is now integrated with `WorkflowCacheManager`, and `WorkflowsService` uses it. This underpins the dynamic Telegram commands. A `tools/flashToolRegistry.js` utility is planned for creating a static version of the registry.

On the services side, `webhookProcessor.js` has been significantly updated to handle the debit/EXP flow and to align with the decoupled notification system (ADR-001). This notification system is also fully functional: `webhookProcessor.js` updates the `generationRecord` (e.g., with results, cost, and `deliveryStatus: 'pending'`), and the separate `NotificationDispatcher.js` polls these records, sends notifications (e.g., via `TelegramNotifier.js`), and updates `deliveryStatus` to 'sent' or 'failed'. This prevents direct coupling of webhook processing to specific platform notifiers. The `generationOutputsApi.js` now has a query endpoint to support the dispatcher's polling.

Platform-wise, `dynamicCommands.js` for Telegram has been refactored to use the Internal API and `ToolRegistry`. It correctly passes `toolId`, `costRate`, `notificationContext` in generation metadata for the debit/notification flows and supports image inputs using `getTelegramFileUrl`. The ComfyUI services (`comfyui.js`, `workflows.js`) have been substantially refactored into smaller modules like `workflowCacheManager.js`, `runManager.js`, `fileManager.js`, and `resourceFetcher.js` for better maintainability.

An internal status report API (`GET /internal/v1/data/users/:masterAccountId/status-report`) and a corresponding Telegram `/status` command are now live, providing users with points, EXP (shown as level and progress bar), wallet, and live task info. An external API (`GET /api/v1/me/status`) with API key authentication also provides this status.

Looking ahead, the detailed plan for Team-based infrastructure and a Job system (multi-step toolchains) from `vibecode/decisions/jobs-teams-sprint-plan.md` is a major ongoing initiative. This will involve new services (`TeamService`, `TeamEconomyService`, `JobOrchestrator`) and requires careful integration with existing debit and context mechanisms.

Our collaboration model, outlined in `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`, emphasizes user-supervised iteration, live demos, and detailed handoffs (in `vibecode/handoffs/`). All project artifacts (prompts, demos, maps, ADRs, etc.) are organized under `/vibecode/`. Remember, working demos are paramount.

A few things to keep top-of-mind:
- Ensure other platform adapters (Discord, Web) are updated to pass all necessary parameters (`toolId`, `costRate`, `notificationContext`, etc.) for the debit/notification systems.
- Test stubs for `webhookProcessor.js`, `dynamicCommands.js`, and `notificationDispatcher.js` need updates for recent changes (debit, EXP, payment failure).
- Refactoring the legacy `PointsService.js` is still on the deck.
- Integrating the upcoming Team and Job systems with current economy and context logic will be a key challenge.
- Consider Discord `/status` command integration using the new internal status API.

We're steadily phasing out old code (e.g., in `utils/bot/`, `oldworkflows.js`, `db.legacy.js`) as we build towards the robust, multi-platform system envisioned in our North Star documents, aiming for a unified experience and revenue generation.
