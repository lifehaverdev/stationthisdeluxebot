Hey team, here's a quick update on where we are with the StationThis refactor and current development efforts.

We're continuing to build out a real-time, creative, cross-platform AI assistant, with a strong emphasis on user-visible progress and practical, working solutions. The user experience is our main driver for system evolution, and we're focusing on demonstration-first iteration.

Architecturally, we're moving towards a cleaner separation of concerns with core services, platform-agnostic logic, platform adapters (Telegram, Discord, Web), and a central API layer. The main application entry is `src/index.js` and `server.js` for the Express server. We've been making good progress on defining clear interfaces between these layers. For instance, all Noema database interactions (for user core data, sessions, events, economy, preferences, and generation outputs) are now centralized through a dedicated internal RESTful API, as decided in ADR-003. This ensures consistency and better security. The detailed Noema database schemas themselves have been defined in ADR-002, covering seven core collections.

A significant recent architectural improvement is the implementation of a standardized debit accounting system (ADR-005). Now, completed generation jobs, particularly from ComfyUI, trigger a debit from the user's `usdCredit` via the internal economy API. This is mainly handled in the `webhookProcessor.js`. This same processor also updates user EXP based on `costUsd` after a successful debit. This ensures that generations are paid for before delivery. If a debit fails, the generation is marked `payment_failed` and not delivered. The legacy `PointsService` is slated for refactoring to use this unified `usdCredit` system. For now, cost accounting for general machine usage, beyond specific generation costs, has been deferred (ADR-001 Cost Accounting Deferral) until core platform features are more stable.

We've also formalized our approach to "tools" â€“ any user-triggerable operation like image generation. ADR-004 outlines a unified `ToolDefinition` schema and a central `ToolRegistry`. This registry is becoming the source of truth for available tools, their inputs, costs, and how platforms should interact with them. This is actively being integrated, for example, with Telegram dynamic commands now leveraging this registry.

On the services front, the `webhookProcessor.js` has seen a lot of updates to support the debit and EXP flow. It now correctly calculates `costUsd`, updates generation records, and calls the internal debit and EXP APIs. The `notificationDispatcher.js` has also been updated to ensure it doesn't send notifications for generations that failed payment, aligning with our decoupled notification system strategy (ADR-001 Decoupled Notifications). This system uses the `generationRecord` to manage notification state, ensuring that the `webhookProcessor` isn't directly tied to specific notifiers like Telegram.

The `dynamicCommands.js` for Telegram has been refined to correctly pass necessary metadata (like `toolId`, `costRate`, `notificationContext`) for the new debit and notification flows. It's also seen improvements in handling image inputs, using a new `getTelegramFileUrl` utility.

There's an ongoing effort to implement Team-based infrastructure and a Job system for multi-step toolchains, as detailed in the `jobs-teams-sprint-plan.md`. This will involve new services like `TeamService`, `TeamEconomyService`, `JobOrchestrator`, and updates to database schemas and API endpoints to handle team contexts and job lifecycles. This is a larger initiative with multiple milestones planned.

Regarding coordination, the `AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md` is our guide. Remember the focus on user-supervised iteration, live demos, and conversational handoffs (which you can find in `vibecode/handoffs/`). All collaboration artifacts have their place under `/vibecode/`. A key principle is "demonstration-first"; working demos define progress.

A few things to keep in mind (TODOs/friction points):
- We need to ensure other platform adapters (Discord, Web) are updated to provide all the necessary parameters (like `toolId`, `costRate`, `notificationContext` in generation metadata) to align with the new debit and notification systems.
- Test stubs, especially for `webhookProcessor.js`, `dynamicCommands.js`, and `notificationDispatcher.js`, need updating to reflect recent changes, including debit, EXP, and payment failure scenarios.
- The refactoring of the legacy `PointsService.js` is still pending.
- As the Team and Job systems are developed, careful integration with existing debit and context mechanisms will be crucial.

The old codebase, particularly parts in `utils/bot/` and legacy services like `oldworkflows.js` and `olddb.legacy.js` (seen in `src/core/services/`), is gradually being phased out or refactored into the new architecture. The North Star remains to unlink core application logic from any single platform, enabling a unified experience across Telegram, Discord, and the web interface, ultimately driving revenue through AI service usage. The web interface vision is an interactive canvas-based workspace.
