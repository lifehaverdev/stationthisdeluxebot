# Discord Implementation Task: Collections Functionality

## Mission Overview
You are tasked with implementing the Collections functionality for Discord in the stationthisdeluxebot system. This is a critical priority for Phase 4 as identified in the 2025-04-21 audit and general direction reset. The Collections functionality must maintain feature parity with the Telegram implementation while adapting to Discord's unique UI capabilities and constraints.

## Target Files and Modules
- Primary focus:
  - `src/integrations/discord/commands/collectionsCommand.js` (create if not exists)
  - `src/integrations/discord/adapters/collectionsAdapter.js` (create if not exists)
- Related components:
  - `src/core/workflow/workflows/CollectionsWorkflow.js` (existing workflow)
  - `src/core/ui/components/collections/` (platform-agnostic components)
- Reference implementations:
  - `src/integrations/telegram/commands/collectionsCommand.js` (Telegram implementation)
  - `src/integrations/discord/commands/makeCommand.js` (Discord command pattern)
  - `tests/integrations/discord/commands/makeCommand.test.js` (testing pattern)

## Current Status
- Core Collections workflow has been implemented in `src/core/workflow/workflows/CollectionsWorkflow.js`
- Telegram adapter for Collections is complete and functioning
- Discord adapter implementation has not been started
- The Discord bot infrastructure is in place and operational
- Discord command routing system is established

## Technical Requirements
1. **Follow Clean Architecture Principles**
   - Utilize the existing platform-agnostic Collections workflow
   - Implement Discord-specific adapters without modifying core logic
   - Maintain separation between UI rendering and business logic
   - Follow established adapter patterns from other Discord commands

2. **Implement Discord-Specific UI**
   - Create Discord-specific UI renderers for collection components
   - Implement paged navigation for collection browsing
   - Utilize Discord embeds for rich media display
   - Create responsive button layouts for collection management
   - Ensure proper image rendering in Discord context

3. **Feature Implementation Requirements**
   - Collection creation through Discord interface
   - Viewing collections with pagination
   - Adding/removing images from collections
   - Collection sharing functionality
   - Collection editing and management
   - Appropriate error handling and user feedback

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for Discord adapters and renderers
   - Integration tests for adapter-workflow interaction
   - E2E tests for critical user journeys
   - Mock testing for Discord API interactions
   - Target 80%+ test coverage

## Success Criteria
- All Collections functionality working in Discord interface
- Feature parity with Telegram implementation
- Tests passing with 80%+ coverage
- Clean separation between Discord-specific code and core logic
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Documentation of Discord-specific implementation details

## Implementation Steps
1. **Analysis and Planning**
   - Review existing Collections workflow implementation
   - Study Discord UI capabilities and constraints
   - Identify necessary adapters and component renderers
   - Create implementation plan with testable milestones

2. **Core Components Implementation**
   - Implement Discord-specific UI renderers for collections components
   - Create Discord command handler for collections commands
   - Implement Discord event listeners for user interactions
   - Connect Discord adapters to core Collections workflow

3. **User Interface Development**
   - Create embeds for collection display
   - Implement button layouts for collection management
   - Design modal interactions for collection creation/editing
   - Ensure proper image display and management

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Develop unit tests for all new components
   - Create integration tests for adapter-workflow interaction
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user journeys
   - Verify feature parity with Telegram implementation

5. **Documentation and Finalization**
   - Document Discord-specific implementation details
   - Create usage examples for collections in Discord
   - Update status tracking documentation
   - Prepare for review and deployment

## Timeline and Priority
This task is a critical priority for Phase 4. The expected timeline is:
- Analysis and Planning: 2 days
- Core Components Implementation: 3-4 days
- User Interface Development: 2-3 days
- Testing and Validation: 2-3 days
- Documentation and Finalization: 1-2 days

Total expected completion time: 10-14 days (target date: 2025-05-12)
