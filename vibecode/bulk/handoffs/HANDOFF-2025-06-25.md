## Work Completed

- **Initial `CreditService` Implementation**: The service now successfully reconciles pending deposits upon application startup. It uses an efficient, group-based confirmation logic that reads the total unconfirmed balance directly from the smart contract's `custody` mapping, as outlined in `ADR-009`. This ensures robustness and gas efficiency for deposits missed while the application was offline.

## Current State

The core deposit confirmation logic is functional but operates only as a batch process on startup. The system is not yet capable of processing on-chain events in real-time, which is a critical dependency for user-facing features.

## Next Tasks

The next phase focuses on building out the live, event-driven capabilities of the `CreditService` and enabling users to connect their wallets to the platform.

1.  **Implement Live Webhook Handler**:
    *   **Goal**: Process `Deposit` events from the `CreditVault` contract in real-time.
    *   **Action**: Implement the Alchemy webhook handler logic within `src/platforms/web/routes/index.js`. This handler will receive event data, parse it, and trigger the existing `CreditService` confirmation logic for the specific deposit. It must be robust enough to handle various event types that Alchemy might send.

2.  **Develop "Magic Amount" Wallet Connection**:
    *   **Goal**: Allow users on platforms like Telegram to link their Ethereum wallet to their application account.
    *   **Action**: Create a user flow where the application generates a unique, small "magic amount" of a token. The user is instructed to send this exact amount to the credit vault. The live webhook handler will detect this deposit, validate the magic amount, and if it matches, create a permanent association between the sender's wallet address (`from` address) and the user's `masterAccountId`.
    *   **Constraint**: Enforce a one-to-one mapping; a wallet address cannot be linked to more than one `masterAccountId`.

3.  **Future Development (Post-Wallet-Connection)**:
    *   **User Credit Liquidation**: Design and implement the logic for settling user debt. When a user consumes credit backed by a volatile asset, the system must monitor the collateral's value and automatically seize and swap the asset if its value drops below a safe threshold. This is a critical risk management feature.
    *   **System Treasury Management**: Implement a secure mechanism for the system to perform withdrawals from the `CreditVault`. This will be used for moving custodied assets to a secure developer wallet or as part of the treasury's risk management strategy.

## Open Questions

*   What is the exact payload structure we will receive from Alchemy for `Deposit` events?
*   Where should the logic for generating, tracking, and validating "magic amounts" for wallet connections reside?
*   What are the specific risk thresholds and parameters that will trigger the user credit liquidation process?
