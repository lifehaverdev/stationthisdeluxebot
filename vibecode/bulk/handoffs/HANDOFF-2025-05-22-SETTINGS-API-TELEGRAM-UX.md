# HANDOFF: 2025-05-22 - Settings API & Telegram UX Prep (Updated 2024-07-30)

## Work Completed (Prior to Settings Menu Implementation)

*   **`UserSettingsService` Authentication Fix:**
    *   Modified `UserSettingsService` methods (`getEffectiveSettings`, `savePreferences`, `getResolvedInput`) to accept an `internalApiKey` parameter.
    *   Updated the `internalApiClient` instance within these methods to use the provided `internalApiKey` in the `X-Internal-Client-Key` header.
*   **Telegram Platform Integration (`dynamicCommands.js`):**
    *   Updated the `bot.onText` handler in `src/platforms/telegram/dynamicCommands.js`.
    *   The call to `services.userSettingsService.getResolvedInput` now correctly passes `process.env.INTERNAL_API_KEY_TELEGRAM` as the `internalApiKey`.
*   **Successful Test & Validation (of UserSettingsService Authentication):**
    *   Logs confirmed that the Telegram platform, when resolving inputs for a tool, now successfully authenticates with the internal `userPreferencesApi`.
    *   User-specific preferences were being correctly fetched and merged.

## Current State (as of 2024-07-30)

*   The core `UserSettingsService` is functional for retrieving, resolving, and saving user preferences per tool.
*   **Telegram Settings Menu Implemented (ADR-007):**
    *   A comprehensive, multi-level inline keyboard menu system for managing user-specific, per-tool settings is now live on Telegram, triggered by `/settings`.
    *   Features include: display of most frequent tools, a paginated "All Tools" list, viewing/editing individual tool parameters (fetched from and saved to `UserSettingsService`), and clear navigation (Back/NVM).
    *   Parameter names are formatted for user-friendliness (e.g., "input_seed" becomes "Seed").
    *   The core logic resides in `src/platforms/telegram/components/settingsMenuManager.js`.
    *   The "User Preferences" section for global settings is scaffolded but temporarily hidden from the UI.
*   User preferences are applied for tool executions, and users can now directly manage these preferences through the new Telegram UI.

## Next Tasks

**Telegram UI/UX Overhaul for Tool Workflow Commands:**

The next major focus will be to significantly improve the user interface and experience when a user invokes a tool/workflow command on Telegram. This involves:

1.  **Immediate Acknowledgment:**
    *   When a user sends a command that triggers a tool workflow (e.g., `/make a cat`), the bot should immediately acknowledge receipt.
    *   This could be a "reaction" to the user's message (e.g., thinking face emoji) via the Telegram Bot API.
    *   *Goal:* Provide instant feedback that the bot has received and is processing the request.
2.  **Enhanced Generation Delivery:**
    *   When a generation is delivered, it should be accompanied by an inline keyboard offering:
        *   **Rate Generation:** Buttons for feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down, stars). Requires backend support for storing ratings.
        *   **View Info:** Display metadata (tool used, seed, parameters, etc.).
        *   **Tweak/Iterate:** Allow easy modification of the last generation's parameters and re-running the tool.
    *   *Goal:* Make generation delivery more interactive, gather feedback, and facilitate iteration.

## Changes to Plan

*   The tasks related to designing and implementing the Telegram settings menu (previously listed as "Next Tasks" in the 2025-05-22 version of this handoff) are now **Completed** as per ADR-007.
*   The focus shifts to the UI/UX overhaul described in the new "Next Tasks" section.

## Open Questions

1.  What are the exact Telegram Bot API capabilities and best practices for message reactions as acknowledgments?
2.  How should generation ratings be stored and accessed (potential new API endpoints, DB schema changes)?
3.  What is the preferred UX for the "Tweak/Iterate" functionality (e.g., new dedicated menu, re-using parts of the settings menu, conversational flow)?
4.  For "View Info" on a generation, what is the best presentation method (new message, edit existing, alert/popup)?
