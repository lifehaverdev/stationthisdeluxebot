# HANDOFF: 2025-06-24

## Work Completed

We have successfully executed a major refactoring of the on-chain deposit confirmation system, evolving it from a naive 1-to-1 event processor into a robust, efficient, and intelligent engine.

1.  **Implemented Group-Based Confirmation Logic**: The `CreditService` was fundamentally refactored. Instead of processing each deposit event individually, it now groups all pending deposits by their unique `(user_address, token_address)` pair.

2.  **Established the Smart Contract as the Source of Truth**: For each group, the service now makes a single read call to the contract's `custody` mapping. It uses the `userOwned` value from this call as the definitive, total unconfirmed balance. This makes our logic perfectly aligned with the on-chain state.

3.  **Solved Unprofitable Transaction Failures**: By confirming the total accumulated balance, the new system avoids failures that previously occurred when trying to process small, individual deposits where the gas cost exceeded the value. The profitability check is now performed on the entire group's value.

4.  **Achieved Gas Efficiency**: The system now sends only **one** `confirmCredit` transaction per `(user, token)` group, significantly reducing the gas fees that would have been spent confirming each deposit individually.

5.  **Updated Architectural Decision Record**: We updated `vibecode/decisions/ADR-009-ONCHAIN-CREDIT-VAULT.md` to formally document this superior group-based processing architecture, ensuring our plans reflect our implementation.

6.  **End-to-End Success**: We successfully tested the new system and observed it correctly group two pending deposits, read their total balance from the chain, execute a single successful confirmation transaction, and update all corresponding records in our database.

## Current State

The `CreditService` is now in a stable and robust state. The pending transaction queue has been successfully cleared, and the service is operating according to the improved, more efficient design. All known bugs related to the confirmation process have been resolved.

## Next Tasks

The core deposit confirmation and crediting feature is now considered stable. The immediate next steps involve hardening the system and preparing for broader use.

1.  **Test Edge Cases**: Conduct tests for more edge cases, such as deposits from unknown wallet addresses, to ensure they are handled gracefully and result in the correct `REJECTED_` status.
2.  **Monitor and Observe**: Allow the service to run and monitor its behavior with any new, organic deposit activity.
3.  **Proceed with Next Development Phase**: With this critical piece of infrastructure complete, we can now move on to the next set of features outlined in the project plan.

## Open Questions

*   None at this time. The refactoring is complete and was a resounding success.
