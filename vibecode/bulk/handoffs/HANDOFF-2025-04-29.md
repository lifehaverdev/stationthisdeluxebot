# HANDOFF: 2025-04-29

## Work Completed

Added a status command to the Discord platform interface to match the existing functionality in the Telegram platform. The implementation:

1. Created a new Discord status command handler (`src/platforms/discord/commands/statusCommand.js`)
2. Updated the Discord bot.js file to register and expose the status command
3. Created unit tests for the status command (`tests/integrations/discord/statusCommand.test.js`)
4. Added Playwright tests to demonstrate the command working (`tests/e2e/discord-status.spec.js`)

## Current State

The StationThis bot now has a `/status` command available on both Telegram and Discord platforms. The command displays:

- Bot uptime in a human-readable format
- Application start time
- Bot user information (on Discord)

The Discord status command shows the information in a visually formatted embed with color coding and field organization.

## Demonstration

The status command functionality can be demonstrated in two ways:

1. Running the Discord bot and using `/status` in a Discord server where the bot is present
2. Running the Playwright test in `tests/e2e/discord-status.spec.js` to see the visual output

The test produces a screenshot in `test-results/discord-status-command.png` showing the command response.

## Testing Instructions

To verify the status command:

1. Start the Discord bot using `node app.js`
2. In a Discord server with the bot, type `/status`
3. Verify that the bot responds with a formatted embed containing uptime and start time
4. For automated testing, run `npx playwright test discord-status.spec.js`

## Next Tasks

1. **Platform Parity**: Consider implementing the status command for the web platform interface
2. **Enhanced Status Information**: Add additional system metrics to the status output (memory usage, connected users, etc.)
3. **Status Command Permissions**: Review if the status command should be restricted to certain user roles

## Changes to Plan

This implementation aligns with the project's goal of providing consistent functionality across platforms. No changes to the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN are required.

## Open Questions

1. Should the status command be accessible to all users or restricted to administrators?
2. What additional system metrics would be valuable to include in the status output?
3. Should we implement a more detailed status command (e.g., `/status --verbose` or `/debug`) for technical diagnostics?
