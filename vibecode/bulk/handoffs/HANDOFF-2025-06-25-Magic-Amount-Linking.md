# HANDOFF: 2025-06-25 (Updated 2025-06-27)

## Work Completed

- **Implemented "Magic Amount" Wallet Linking:** We have fully implemented the backend infrastructure for linking user wallets via a unique "magic amount" deposit, as outlined in `ADR-009-ONCHAIN-CREDIT-VAULT.md`. This provides a secure, gasless (for the user) linking method for non-browser platforms like Telegram.

- **New Public API Endpoints:** Added new public-facing endpoints to handle the wallet linking flow for new, anonymous users:
    - `POST /api/v1/wallets/connect/initiate`: Starts the process and returns a unique magic amount.
    - `GET /api/v1/wallets/connect/status/:requestId`: Allows polling for status and claiming the API key upon completion.

- **New Services:** Created `WalletLinkingRequestDB` to track requests and `WalletLinkingService` to orchestrate the core logic.

- **Enhanced `CreditService`:** The `CreditService` has been updated to check every incoming deposit against pending magic amount requests *before* processing it for credit.

### End-to-End Testing & Bug Fixes (June 27)

- **Conducted successful end-to-end testing** of the entire "magic amount" flow, from API call to key retrieval.
- **Fixed Native ETH Deposits:** Modified `WalletLinkingService` to correctly use the zero address (`0x00...00`) as a default for native ETH deposits, resolving an issue where a missing environment variable caused failures.
- **Resolved Database Error:** Implemented a missing `findById` method in `WalletLinkingRequestDB` to allow for successful status checks and API key claims.
- **Fixed Race Condition:** Updated `CreditService` to prevent magic deposits from being processed for credits simultaneously with wallet linking. This resolved an error where the system would fail to find the user associated with the brand-new wallet.

## Current State

- The backend system is feature-complete **and has been successfully tested end-to-end**.
- The system can now robustly handle the entire flow:
    1. Generate a unique magic amount request for a new user.
    2. Detect the corresponding on-chain ETH deposit.
    3. Securely link the new wallet to the user account.
    4. Generate and cache the initial API key.
    5. Allow the user to claim the API key successfully.
- The system is now **verified and ready** to be integrated with a client-facing platform adapter (e.g., Telegram).

## Next Tasks

- **Client-Side Integration:** The primary next step is for a platform adapter (e.g., `telegram/bot.js`) to be updated to use this new functionality.
- **Implement User Flow:** The adapter needs a new command or flow that:
    1.  Calls the `POST /api/v1/wallets/connect/initiate` endpoint to get a magic amount.
    2.  Presents this information clearly to the user.
    3.  Instructs them to send the *exact* magic amount to the application's vault address.
    4.  Guides the user to poll the `GET /api/v1/wallets/connect/status/:requestId` endpoint to retrieve their API key.

## Changes to Plan

- No deviations from the high-level plan. This work directly implements a required component described in the on-chain credit ADR.

## Open Questions

- What is the ideal user experience for instructing a user to make a specific on-chain transaction from within a chat interface?
- How should the system handle edge cases, such as a user sending the wrong amount or the request expiring before the deposit is made? *(Note: The race condition was one such edge case that has now been addressed.)*
