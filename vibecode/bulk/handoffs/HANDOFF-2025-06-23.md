# HANDOFF: 2025-06-23

## Work Completed

We have successfully executed a major refactoring of the on-chain deposit and credit system, moving it from a simple event processor to a robust, user-aware, and economically sound service.

1.  **Architectural Vision Formalized**: We updated `vibecode/decisions/ADR-009-ONCHAIN-CREDIT-VAULT.md` to serve as our north star. The ADR now mandates that before any on-chain transaction is attempted, the system must (1) verify the deposit belongs to a known user in our system and (2) apply the credit to that user's off-chain balance upon success.

2.  **User Account Verification Implemented**: The core of our work was refactoring `src/core/services/alchemy/creditService.js`. It now performs a mandatory lookup to link a depositor's wallet address to an internal `masterAccountId`.
    *   To support this, we created a new, crucial endpoint: `GET /internal/v1/data/wallets/lookup` in `src/api/internal/walletsApi.js`.
    *   We then correctly integrated the new routing structure into `src/api/internal/userCoreApi.js`.

3.  **Intelligent Gas Fee Handling**: We upgraded `creditService.js` to pass the estimated gas cost as a `fee` parameter to the `confirmCredit` smart contract function. This allows the contract to atomically handle the fee during the confirmation process, ensuring our operator wallet is compensated without a separate transaction.

4.  **Full End-to-End Crediting Flow**: We completed the loop by ensuring `creditService.js` makes a final internal API call to `POST /users/{masterAccountId}/economy/credit`. This call leverages the existing `userEconomyApi.js` to update the user's `usdCredit` balance in the database, making the credit immediately available to the user for services.

5.  **Dependency Injection Fixed**: We updated `src/core/services/index.js` to correctly inject the `internalApiClient` into the `CreditService`, enabling the cross-service communication required for the new features.

## Current State

The `CreditService` and its surrounding APIs are now fully implemented according to the new, more robust specification in `ADR-009`. All code is in place for a complete, end-to-end test of the deposit confirmation and crediting lifecycle. The system is ready to be started and tested against a real-world deposit event.

## Next Tasks

The immediate and sole focus is **testing and verification**.

1.  **Execute End-to-End Test**: Start the application (`node src/index.js`) and allow the `CreditService` to begin its reconciliation process.
2.  **Monitor Success Path**: Closely watch the logs to verify each step of the new process for a pending deposit:
    *   **User Lookup**: Confirm a successful `GET` request to `/wallets/lookup`.
    *   **Gas Calculation**: Confirm the gas `fee` is calculated correctly.
    *   **On-Chain Confirmation**: Verify the `confirmCredit` transaction is sent and confirmed on-chain.
    *   **Off-Chain Credit**: Confirm a successful `POST` request to `/economy/credit`.
    *   **Database Verification**: Manually inspect the `credit_ledger` and `userEconomy` collections to ensure the final state is correct.
3.  **Plan for Error Path Testing**: Once the success path is confirmed, we must test the new failure modes, such as deposits from unknown wallets, to ensure they are handled gracefully and result in the correct `REJECTED_` status.

## Open Questions

*   None at this time. The plan is clear, and the next step is execution.
