# HANDOFF: 2024-06-10

## Work Completed
- Refactored all Telegram command handlers to use the new dependency injection and internal API routing pattern.
- Updated all dynamic command, status, and menu handlers to resolve masterAccountId via the internal API.
- Standardized callback query dispatcher and all menu callback handlers (settings, mods, training, spells) to use the signature `(bot, callbackQuery, masterAccountId, dependencies)`.
- Removed redundant internal find-or-create logic from menu callback handlers.
- Updated all internal API calls in menu managers to use `dependencies.internal.client` and the `/internal/v1/data/` prefix.
- Verified that `/status`, `/train`, `/mods`, `/settings`, and `/spells` commands now work and open their respective menus.
- Ensured dynamic commands and menu navigation are functional for the main flows.

## Current State
- Telegram bot command and menu system is operational and consistent with the new architecture.
- All main menu and command entry points are working, including dynamic commands and callback query handling.
- Dependency injection and user resolution are now robust and DRY across all handlers.
- Some sub-menus and advanced menu flows may still need further dependency cleanup or testing.

## Next Tasks
- Audit and refactor any remaining sub-menu or nested menu handlers to ensure they use the correct dependencies and masterAccountId resolution.
- Add/expand Playwright or equivalent tests to demonstrate menu and command flows.
- Review and update documentation for new handler signatures and dependency patterns.
- Continue user-driven iteration to address any remaining edge cases or missing features in menu navigation.

## Changes to Plan
- No major deviations from the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md; all changes align with the North Star and collaboration protocol.
- Some menu handler signatures were updated for consistency and maintainability.

## Open Questions
- Are there any remaining menu flows or features that are not yet covered by the new dependency pattern?
- Should we further abstract the masterAccountId resolution for even more DRYness?
- Are there any additional architectural improvements needed for future platform support?
