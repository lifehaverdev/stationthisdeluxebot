# API Module Audit

## üßæ Folder Overview

The API module implements HTTP/REST interfaces for the application, providing programmatic access to system functionality. This allows external services or web applications to interact with the core business logic without going through the Telegram interface.

The module appears to be relatively simple, with a main index.js file likely defining routes and endpoints, and a test.js file for API testing.

## üìÅ File-by-file Summary

### index.js
Implements the main API routing and endpoint definitions. This file likely sets up an Express or similar web framework to handle HTTP requests, defines routes, and connects them to the appropriate handlers that invoke core business logic.

### test.js
Contains test cases or utilities for testing the API endpoints. This may include mock requests, response validators, or integration tests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Service/Dependency Notes

The API module likely depends on:
- A web framework (probably Express.js)
- Core domain services for business logic
- Authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Request validation utilities
- Response formatting utilities

This module acts as an adapter between HTTP/REST interfaces and the core domain, translating between HTTP requests/responses and domain models/operations.

## üìå Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- `src/core` for domain services and business logic
- `src/utils` for error handling, logging, and formatting
- `src/services` for application-specific operations

### Dependencies from other folders:
- May be initialized from `src/bootstrap.js`
- Possibly referenced from `src/integrations/web` if there's overlap in web functionality

## Technical Debt Notes

- The API structure is minimal, with only two files visible
- Documentation for API endpoints may be lacking
- The relationship between this API and any web interfaces in `src/integrations/web` should be clarified
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms may need to be enhanced for a public API
- API versioning strategy is unclear
