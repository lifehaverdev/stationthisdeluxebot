# Examples Module Audit

## üßæ Folder Overview

The examples module contains sample code, demonstrations, and usage patterns for various components of the system. These examples serve as documentation through code, showing developers how to properly use the application's APIs, services, and components.

## üìÅ File-by-file Summary

There are no visible files in the listing, but the folder likely contains:

- Example scripts for common operations
- Sample integrations
- Usage patterns for core services
- Demonstration code for API consumption
- Reference implementations for adapters

## üõ†Ô∏è Service/Dependency Notes

The examples module:
- Depends on the actual implementation code it demonstrates
- Should not be used in production
- May include simplified versions of complex operations
- May contain instructional comments explaining usage

## üìå Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- Likely depends on most other folders in the codebase to demonstrate their usage
- May have dependencies on `src/utils` for helper functions
- May reference `src/config` for configuration examples

### Dependencies from other folders:
- Should have no dependencies from production code
- Documentation may reference these examples

## Technical Debt Notes

- Examples may become outdated as the codebase evolves
- Some examples might not follow current best practices
- Coverage of all major system components in examples may be incomplete
- Examples may not include proper error handling for simplicity
