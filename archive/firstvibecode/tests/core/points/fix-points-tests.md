# Points Service Test Fixes

## Location
- Target file: `tests/core/points/points.test.js`
- Run with: `npm test -- tests/core/points/points.test.js`

## Issues Fixed

1. **Method name mismatches**: The tests were trying to use a non-existent `getOrCreateUserPoints` method instead of the actual `getUserPoints` method implemented in the service.

2. **Constructor parameter names**: The PointsService constructor parameters were incorrectly named in the tests (`repository` and `calculation` instead of `pointsRepository` and `calculationService`).

3. **Repository method naming**: The test was using outdated repository method names (such as `updateUserPoints`) instead of the correct methods like `incrementPoints` and `decrementPoints`.

4. **Mock structure issues**: The mock implementations did not reflect the actual behavior of the repository and calculation service.

5. **Event publishing**: The tests were using an incorrect way to spy on and test event publications.

6. **Model usage**: The tests were not using the `UserPoints` model class when mocking repository responses.

7. **Validation test cases**: Missing test cases for method parameter validation (e.g., amount must be positive).

8. **Regeneration logic**: The tests for point regeneration were not aligned with the actual implementation that decreases doints instead of increasing points.

## Improvements Made

1. **Correctly mocked UserPoints objects**: Used the UserPoints class to create proper model instances in tests.

2. **Added validation test cases**: Added tests to verify parameter validation (e.g., amounts must be positive).

3. **Properly structured repository mocks**: Created more realistic implementations of the repository methods that match the actual behavior.

4. **Fixed event publishing mocks**: Correctly mocked the eventBus module and its publish method.

5. **Added tests for hasSufficientPoints**: Created test cases to verify the hasSufficientPoints method behaves correctly with different amounts.

6. **Fixed regeneration tests**: Correctly tested the point regeneration logic that decreases doints.

7. **Improved test readability**: Made the tests more focused and easier to understand by removing unnecessary code.

## Verification

All tests now pass successfully when running:
```
npm test -- tests/core/points/points.test.js
```

Total of 12 test cases are now covered, providing good test coverage for the PointsService functionality.
