# Service Adapter Architecture

## Overview
Service adapters wrap external services into standardized interfaces that our internal API can consume without knowing the implementation details of each service.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Black Box Execution**
   - Each service presents a uniform interface
   - Implementation details hidden from consumers
   - Configuration handled at adapter level

2. **Standard Request/Response Format**
   - Consistent input parameter format
   - Normalized response structure
   - Standardized error handling

3. **Cost Tracking**
   - Pre-execution cost estimates
   - Post-execution actual cost logging
   - User credit validation before execution

4. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Automatic retry logic
   - Graceful degradation
   - Circuit breaker pattern

## Service Adapter Interface

```javascript
class ServiceAdapter {
  // Required methods all services must implement
  async execute(params, context) {}
  async getEstimatedCost(params) {}
  async validateParams(params) {}
  
  // Optional methods with default implementations
  async init() {}
  async shutdown() {}
  async healthCheck() {}
}
```

## Common Services to Implement

1. **Image Generation Services**
   - ComfyDeploy
   - StableDiffusion
   - DALL-E

2. **Text Generation Services**
   - GPT-4
   - Claude
   - Llama

3. **Media Processing Services**
   - Watermarking
   - Image optimization
   - Format conversion

4. **Storage Services**
   - MongoDB
   - S3/Cloud Storage
   - Local filesystem

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Create Base Service Adapter**
   - Define interface contract
   - Implement shared utilities
   - Add logging and monitoring

2. **Migrate Existing Services**
   - Convert make.js to service adapter
   - Convert waterMark.js to service adapter
   - Convert speak.js to service adapter

3. **Add New Service Adapters**
   - Add additional generation services
   - Add storage adapters
   - Add analytics services

4. **Service Registry**
   - Create central registry for all services
   - Add discovery and metadata
   - Implement health monitoring

## Service Execution Flow

1. Client calls internal API
2. Internal API validates request
3. Service adapter is retrieved from registry
4. Cost is calculated and verified against user credit
5. Service is executed with standardized parameters
6. Response is normalized and returned
7. Usage is logged and billed

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each adapter
- Mock external services in tests
- Integration tests with sandboxed services
- Performance testing under load
