# Test Infrastructure Formalization Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of formalizing the test infrastructure for stationthisdeluxebot. Based on the 2025-04-21 audit and general direction reset, test infrastructure formalization is identified as a high priority for Phase 4.

## Goals
- Establish consistent testing patterns across the codebase
- Implement comprehensive unit test coverage for all core services
- Create integration tests for cross-service functionality
- Develop end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Improve overall test coverage to at least 80% for core components

## Current Status: 🟠 IN PROGRESS

### Completed Features
- ✅ Core testing framework setup
- ✅ Unit test structure for domain models
- ✅ Mocking patterns for external services
- ✅ E2E tests for make image workflow
- ✅ E2E tests for account workflow

### In-Progress Features
- 🔄 Test coverage improvement for core services
- 🔄 Integration test implementation
- 🔄 Test documentation standardization
- 🔄 Test organization restructuring

### Not Started
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline implementation
- ❌ Performance testing framework
- ❌ Test coverage for API layer
- ❌ Test coverage for Discord adapter
- ❌ Comprehensive regression test suite

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Core Domain Test Coverage | 90% | 70% | 🟠 In Progress |
| Services Test Coverage | 80% | 30% | 🔴 Below Target |
| Commands Test Coverage | 85% | 60% | 🟠 In Progress |
| E2E Test Coverage | 75% | 40% | 🟠 In Progress |
| Documentation Coverage | 100% | 50% | 🟠 In Progress |

## Dependencies
- Core services implementation
- Command and workflow infrastructure
- Platform adapters (Telegram, Discord)
- Jest and testing libraries

## Blockers
- Inconsistent test organization between `tests/` and `src/core/*/tests/` directories
- Some services lack clear interfaces for effective mocking
- Limited test documentation for complex workflows
- Some platform-specific code difficult to test without refactoring

## Next Tasks (Prioritized)
1. Standardize Test Organization
   - Move tests from `src/core/*/tests/` to `tests/core/*/`
   - Establish consistent naming conventions
   - Create directory structure guidelines
   - Update documentation and examples

2. Improve Service Layer Test Coverage
   - Implement tests for remaining services
   - Create mocking patterns for external dependencies
   - Add test cases for error handling
   - Ensure all critical services have at least 80% coverage

3. Enhance Integration Testing
   - Create framework for testing service interactions
   - Implement tests for core workflows across services
   - Add tests for database integrations
   - Create mocks for external API dependencies

4. Implement E2E Testing for Critical Flows
   - Expand test coverage for image generation workflows
   - Add tests for account management workflows
   - Create tests for collections management
   - Implement tests for points transactions

5. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
   - Configure GitHub Actions or alternative CI system
   - Implement automated test runs on PR creation
   - Add code coverage reporting
   - Create test status badges for repositories

## Timeline
- Test Organization Standardization: Expected completion by 2025-05-05
- Service Layer Test Coverage: Expected completion by 2025-05-20
- Integration Testing Enhancement: Expected completion by 2025-06-05
- E2E Testing Implementation: Expected completion by 2025-06-15
- CI/CD Pipeline Setup: Expected completion by 2025-06-25
