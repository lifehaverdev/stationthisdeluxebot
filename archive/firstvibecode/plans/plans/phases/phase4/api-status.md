# API Layer Development Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of developing the API layer for stationthisdeluxebot. Based on the 2025-04-21 audit and general direction reset, API layer development is identified as a high priority for Phase 4.

## Goals
- Design RESTful API structure for third-party integrations
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Create endpoints for core platform features
- Develop comprehensive API documentation
- Build SDK examples for common integration patterns
- Maintain clean separation between API layer and core business logic
- Implement comprehensive testing for all API endpoints

## Current Status: 🔴 NOT STARTED

### Completed Features
- ✅ Initial API router infrastructure
- ✅ Basic endpoint scaffolding
- ✅ Authentication mechanism design

### In-Progress Features
- 🔄 API architecture documentation
- 🔄 Authentication implementation
- 🔄 Core endpoints definition

### Not Started
- ❌ API implementation for core functionality
- ❌ Documentation generation
- ❌ SDK examples
- ❌ API testing framework
- ❌ Rate limiting and security features
- ❌ Error handling standardization

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Endpoint Coverage | 100% | 10% | 🔴 Not Started |
| Test Coverage | 80% | 5% | 🔴 Not Started |
| Documentation | 100% | 15% | 🔴 In Planning |
| Security Features | 100% | 5% | 🔴 Not Started |

## Dependencies
- Core services layer for business logic
- Authentication system for user verification
- Workflow engine for complex operations
- ComfyDeploy service integration

## Blockers
- API design patterns need formalization
- Authentication strategy needs finalization
- Service layer test coverage needs improvement for reliable API integration

## Next Tasks (Prioritized)
1. Complete API Architecture Documentation
   - Define API design principles
   - Create endpoint naming conventions
   - Establish versioning strategy
   - Document authentication approach
   - Define error handling standards

2. Implement Authentication System
   - Create authentication endpoints
   - Implement JWT token generation and validation
   - Add role-based permission system
   - Build test suite for authentication components

3. Develop Core API Endpoints
   - Implement user management endpoints
   - Create image generation endpoints
   - Add collection management API
   - Implement points and transaction API
   - Build model training endpoints

4. Create API Testing Framework
   - Develop API-specific testing utilities
   - Implement automated endpoint testing
   - Create integration tests with service layer
   - Build performance and load testing tools

5. Implement Security Features
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement request validation
   - Create audit logging
   - Add CORS configuration

## Timeline
- API Architecture Documentation: Expected completion by 2025-05-05
- Authentication System: Expected completion by 2025-05-15
- Core API Endpoints: Expected completion by 2025-05-30
