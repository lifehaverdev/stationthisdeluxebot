## Overview
This document tracks the progress of completing the Discord adapter implementation for stationthisdeluxebot. Based on the 2025-04-21 audit and general direction reset, Discord adapter completion is identified as a critical priority for Phase 4.

## Goals
- Complete implementation of remaining Discord commands
- Implement Collections functionality for Discord
- Implement Train Commands for Discord
- Ensure feature parity with Telegram adapter
- Maintain clean separation between platform-specific code and core logic
- Implement comprehensive testing for all Discord components

## Current Status: 🟠 IN PROGRESS

### Completed Features
- ✅ Core Discord bot infrastructure
- ✅ Basic command handling system
- ✅ User authentication and identification
- ✅ Basic image generation commands
- ✅ Points management integration
- ✅ UI component rendering for Discord

### In-Progress Features
- 🔄 Collections functionality implementation
- 🔄 Media management commands
- 🔄 Account management commands
- 🔄 Status command integration

### Not Started
- ❌ Train Commands implementation
- ❌ Advanced workflow integration
- ❌ Comprehensive testing suite
- ❌ Discord-specific UI improvements
- ❌ Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Command Coverage | 100% | 65% | 🟠 In Progress |
| Test Coverage | 80% | 30% | 🔴 Below Target |
| Feature Parity | 100% | 70% | 🟠 In Progress |
| Code Quality | <5 linting issues | 12 issues | 🔴 Below Target |

## Dependencies
- Core workflow system for complex Discord interactions
- Platform-agnostic UI components
- Services layer for business logic
- Authentication system for user verification

## Blockers
- Collections workflow requires adaptation for Discord's unique UI constraints
- Train Commands implementation blocked by integration testing framework completion
- Discord-specific error handling patterns need standardization

## Next Tasks (Prioritized)
1. Complete Collections functionality implementation
   - Design Discord-specific UI for collections management
   - Implement collection creation, viewing, and editing commands
   - Add collection sharing functionality
   - Create tests for collections workflow

2. Implement Train Commands
   - Design command interface for model training
   - Implement progress tracking and notification
   - Create validation for training parameters
   - Build tests for training workflow

3. Enhance Testing Framework
   - Develop Discord-specific testing utilities
   - Implement mock Discord interactions
   - Create end-to-end test suite for critical workflows
   - Add unit tests for Discord-specific adapters

4. Improve Error Handling
   - Implement Discord-specific error messages
   - Create recovery mechanisms for failed workflows
   - Design user-friendly error presentation
   - Test error scenarios and recovery paths

## Timeline
- Collections Functionality: Expected completion by 2025-05-05
- Train Commands: Expected completion by 2025-05-15
- Testing Improvements: Ongoing through May 2025
- Final Integration and Testing: Expected by 2025-05-30
