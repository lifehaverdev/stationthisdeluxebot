# Commands Module Audit

## üßæ Folder Overview

The commands module contains implementation of user-facing commands that can be executed through various integration platforms (primarily Telegram). Each file in this directory defines a set of related commands that provide specific functionality to the end-user.

The commands interface between the user inputs and the core business logic, acting as controllers that coordinate between the user interface and the application services.

## üìÅ File-by-file Summary

### accountCommands.js
Implements commands related to user account management such as registration, profile viewing/editing, and authentication. This file contains handlers for commands like `/account`, `/login`, `/register`, etc.

### makeCommand.js
Handles commands related to content generation, particularly AI image generation. Likely contains the implementation for the `/make` command that generates images based on user prompts.

### mediaCommand.js
Implements commands for media manipulation, possibly for tasks like image editing, formatting, or transformations. This may include commands for applying filters, resizing, or other operations on user-supplied media.

### statusCommand.js
Provides system status information and diagnostics. Likely includes commands such as `/status` that display the current state of the bot, uptime, and other system metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Service/Dependency Notes

The command modules depend on:
- Core domain services for business logic
- Session management for user state
- Platform-specific APIs (likely Telegram Bot API)
- Authentication and authorization services
- Error handling utilities

The commands are likely adapting between platform-specific integration code and core domain models.

## üìå Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- `src/core` for domain services and business logic
- `src/services` for specialized operations (image generation, etc.)
- `src/utils` for formatting, error handling, and other utilities
- `src/integrations` for platform-specific functionality

### Dependencies from other folders:
- Commands are registered and executed from `src/integrations` modules
- `src/bootstrap.js` likely initializes and registers commands
- Command execution may be monitored by `src/core/analytics`
