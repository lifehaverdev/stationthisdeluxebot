# Utils Module Audit

## üßæ Folder Overview

The utils module contains cross-cutting utility functions and helpers that are used throughout the application. These utilities provide common functionality that doesn't belong to any specific domain or feature, such as logging, formatting, and error handling.

This folder adheres to the principle of keeping utility code separate from business logic, ensuring that core domain code remains focused on modeling the problem domain rather than technical concerns.

## üìÅ File-by-file Summary

### errors.js
Defines error classes, error handling utilities, and possibly error reporting mechanisms. Likely centralizes error management to ensure consistent error handling throughout the application.

### formatters.js
Contains functions for formatting data for presentation, such as date formatting, number formatting, and text transformations. These utilities help maintain consistent presentation across different parts of the application.

### helpers.js
General-purpose helper functions that don't fit into other categories. May include common data manipulation routines, validation helpers, and other miscellaneous utilities.

### logger.js
Implements logging infrastructure, potentially with different log levels, formatting options, and output destinations. Provides a consistent logging interface throughout the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Service/Dependency Notes

The utils module:
- Should have minimal external dependencies
- May depend on standard libraries or small utility packages
- Should not depend on domain-specific modules
- Should not contain business logic

These utilities are designed to be simple, reusable, and independent of specific application contexts.

## üìå Cross-System Notes

### Dependencies on other folders:
- Should have minimal or no dependencies on other application folders
- May depend on configuration settings in `src/config`

### Dependencies from other folders:
- Used throughout the entire codebase
- Core domain models may use these utilities for non-domain concerns
- Commands and integrations likely heavily use these utilities
- Services may use these utilities for common operations

## Technical Debt Notes

- Utility functions may accumulate over time without proper organization
- Some utilities might contain domain-specific logic that should be moved to appropriate domain modules
- The separation between general utilities and domain-specific helpers may not always be clear
- Documentation for individual utility functions may be inconsistent
