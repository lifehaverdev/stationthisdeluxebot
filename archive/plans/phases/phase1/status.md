# Phase 1 Status: Service Extraction and Core Creation

## ✅ Overall Goals
- [x] Core user domain model and service extracted
- [x] Points calculation + regeneration logic extracted
- [x] Generation request/response models defined
- [x] Repository pattern established
- [x] Event bus scaffolded

## 📁 src/core/user/
- [x] `model.js` created
- [x] `service.js` with basic lifecycle methods (create, load, update)
- [x] `repository.js` or interface implemented
- [x] `README.md` written

## 📁 src/core/points/
- [x] `model.js` defines point types
- [x] `calculation.js` performs adds/spends
- [x] `regeneration.js` handles periodic refill
- [x] `README.md` written

## 📁 src/core/generation/
- [x] `request.js` and `response.js` defined
- [x] `README.md` written

## 📁 src/core/shared/
- [x] `events.js` created
- [x] `repository.js` interface added

## 🔄 Integration Progress
- [ ] `gatekeep.js` adapted to use new user service
- [ ] `points.js` adapted to call points module
- [ ] Old logic still functional (backwards compatibility check)

## 🧪 Tests
- [x] `tests/user.test.js` created
- [x] `tests/points.test.js` created
- [x] `tests/setup.js` (test config)

## Notes
- Core domain models are all fully implemented with proper documentation
- Repositories have been created with backward compatibility in mind
- Services implement all required business logic for each domain
- Event bus for cross-domain communication has been implemented
- The index.js files properly export all components for each module
- Test infrastructure is set up with Jest
- Test files are created but need alignment with actual implementation
- Integration with legacy code is the next step in the refactoring process
- Need to revise test mocks to match the actual implementation details
