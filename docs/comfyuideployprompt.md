üöÄ Updated Meta Prompt: StationThis Bot Refactor ‚Äî ComfyUI Deploy Integration Focus
You are helping with the StationThis bot refactoring project, which is now entering a new initiative phase.

The new primary objective is to overhaul StationThis to integrate directly with the ComfyUI Deploy platform.

This supersedes previous approaches based on our internal database.
Your priority is now:

üéØ Primary Objective:
Seamlessly integrate with ComfyUI Deploy, using its documented API endpoints as the primary source of truth.

Deprecate reliance on the local database for workflow information or task tracking unless explicitly required for caching or optimization.

üìö Key Documents to Review:
The ComfyUI Deploy documentation located at:
M:\make\comfyui-deploy\docs

/API/ENDPOINTS_LIST.md

/API/AUTOMATED_ENDPOINTS_SCRAPE.md

/API/DYNAMIC_ROUTES_EXPLAINED.md

/COMPONENTS/

/SETUP/

üõ† Updated Agent Instructions:
First, review the ComfyUI Deploy documentation carefully.

Based on that review:

Identify the next logical task to improve StationThis's compatibility with ComfyUI Deploy

Determine which components must be modified, deprecated, or created to achieve direct API integration

Understand any updated architectural guidelines based on ComfyUI Deploy's structure and endpoints

When beginning work:

State clearly which component you are working on and which phase of the StationThis refactor it belongs to

Explain how the implementation strategy leverages ComfyUI Deploy's API as the authoritative source

Propose a practical, achievable approach that follows the "practical over perfect" principle

Ongoing agent practices:

Keep interfaces simple, resilient, and API-driven

Focus on practical integration ‚Äî do not create unnecessary abstraction layers unless needed

Document your work according to AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md

Update the progress tracking documents upon completing each task

‚ùó Important Changes to Previous Behavior:
Primary data source = ComfyUI Deploy API, not internal database.

Database fallback is allowed only for caching, logging, or secondary lookups, and must be clearly documented.

Direct API calls should handle workflows, deployments, runs, uploads, and machines wherever possible.

‚úÖ Initial Next Step:
Scan /API/ENDPOINTS_LIST.md and /AUTOMATED_ENDPOINTS_SCRAPE.md

Cross-reference StationThis features (like run creation, workflow management) against available ComfyUI Deploy endpoints

Propose a plan to replace internal database workflow fetching with live ComfyUI Deploy API integration

üî• Closing Reminder:
This initiative represents a shift of StationThis toward true vertical integration with ComfyUI Deploy.
All work should optimize for compatibility, resilience, and minimum duplication with ComfyUI Deploy‚Äôs infrastructure.
