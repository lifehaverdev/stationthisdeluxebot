üß† AGENT INITIATION PROTOCOL: STRATEGIC GENERAL DIRECTION RESET

üóÇÔ∏è META
Title: General Direction Realignment Based on Audit
Date: 2025-04-21
Author: system-agent
Intent: Establish new high-level strategy to guide future work post-audit
Type: general-direction-meta-prompt
Target: Entire stationthisdeluxebot refactor ecosystem

üéØ PRIMARY GOAL:
You are being deployed to create a strategic reset and directional alignment for the next stages of work on the stationthisdeluxebot project.

This is based on:

Recent Audit results (2025-04-21)

Refactor Master Plan (REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md)

Phase progress documents in /plans/phases/

You must now synthesize this information into a new clear and executable strategic outline.

üìã CONTEXT TO CONSIDER

Core Services are ‚úÖ Strong and Stable

Platform-Agnostic Workflows are ‚úÖ Complete

Telegram Adapter is ‚úÖ Near Complete

Discord Adapter is ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete (Collections, Train Commands missing)

API Layer is ‚ùå Missing (planned for Phase 4)

Testing is ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak (documentation mentions, but limited actual test coverage)

Documentation is ‚úÖ Strong

The audit reveals a highly successful Phase 1-3 completion but flags necessary focus areas for Phase 4 and beyond.

üõ§Ô∏è MISSION OBJECTIVES

Create a General Direction Blueprint that:

Prioritizes remaining work based on impact and dependency

Aligns tactical next steps to the original master plan intent

Creates clear groupings of work areas ("verticals")

Sets a tempo and execution pattern for future agent handoffs

üõ†Ô∏è OUTPUT EXPECTATION

You must create a strategic direction document that includes:

Vertical Prioritization:

Discord Completion

API Layer Development

Test Infrastructure Formalization

Web Adapter Planning/Initiation

Execution Mode:

Maintain modular, compositional implementation

Preserve platform-agnostic core separation

Implement comprehensive agent-written test coverage (unit + integration)

Delivery Ritual:

Each vertical should produce:

New /plans/phases/phase4/{vertical}-status.md

Vibecode prompts for execution (/vibecode/prompts/)

Associated maps (/vibecode/maps/) for context

Quality Controls:

No new workflows or services without accompanying unit tests

No platform-specific leaks into platform-agnostic workflows

Every new major feature must be documented in /docs/

Save your strategic document to:
/vibecode/maps/2025-04-21-general-direction-reset.md

‚ö†Ô∏è BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES

Remain aligned to the original architectural intent (clean layering, compositional system)

Honor all previous architectural decision records (ADRs)

Prefer minimal but high-impact actions in the short term

Bias toward preserving the strong foundations already built

üì¶ FUTURE USE
This new general direction document will serve as the canonical foundation for launching Phase 4 work ‚Äî beginning with Discord Adapter completion and API layer construction.
