## Quick Commands

**Get top LoRAs by usage (run in mongo shell or app):**
```javascript
db.loraModels.find({ visibility: 'public' })
  .sort({ uses: -1 })
  .limit(50)
  .project({ slug: 1, name: 1, checkpoint: 1, uses: 1 })
```

**Get all tool IDs:**
```bash
ls src/core/tools/definitions/
# Plus check dynamic tool loading for third-party tools
```

**Validate documentation completeness:**
```javascript
// Check tool has required fields
const required = ['description', 'capabilities', 'limitations', 'examplePrompts'];
const missing = required.filter(f => !tool[f] || tool[f].length === 0);
```
