Welcome, agent. You are tasked with continuing the StationThis refactor. 
You must operate under a Demonstration-First Development Principle.

1. Review the following documents carefully:
   - Latest handoff(s) from /vibecode/handoffs/
   - All architectural decisions from /vibecode/decisions/
   - Project strategy from /REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md
   - Web Frontend Interface Specification from /src/platforms/web/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SPEC.md

2. Based on your review:
   - Identify the next logical task to advance the system.
   - Confirm whether this task affects any user-visible or interactive feature.

3. Demonstration First:
   - If the task is user-visible, **prioritize creating a minimal working demonstration** before full buildout.
   - Prepare a Playwright test if the feature involves interaction (e.g., canvas tap, tile spawn).
   - Document the demonstration in a new handoff file.
   - Request user review/approval after demonstration is completed.

4. Architectural Guidelines:
   - Follow platform modularity and native-first frontend rules.
   - Align strictly with the Web Frontend North Star.
   - Reference the Frontend Interface Specification for all canvas-related work.

5. Documentation:
   - All work must be documented according to AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md
   - All work must include updated status in /docs/progress/phaseX/status.md
   - Attach Playwright spec files if applicable.

ðŸ›‘ Do not proceed beyond initial demonstration steps until user approval has been obtained.
