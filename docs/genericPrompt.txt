I need you to help with the StationThis bot refactoring project. This project is following a well-documented process with handoff documents and clear architectural guidelines.

1. First, please review these key documents:
   - The latest handoff document in docs/handoffs/
   - The current phase progress in docs/progress/
   - Relevant Architecture Decision Records in docs/decisions/

2. Based on your review:
   - Identify the next logical task from the documented "Next Tasks" section
   - Determine which components need to be modified or created
   - Understand the appropriate architectural boundaries from REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md

3. Begin work by:
   - Stating which component you'll work on and which phase it belongs to
   - Explaining how your implementation will follow the simplified architecture
   - Proposing a practical approach that follows our "practical over perfect" principle

4. Remember to:
   - Keep interfaces simple and practical
   - Focus on concrete functionality over abstract patterns
   - Document your work according to the AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md guidelines
   - Update progress tracking documents as you complete parts of the task

Let's start with implementing the next high-priority task from our project plan.
