# HANDOFF: PHASE 4 - WEB CANVAS DEMONSTRATION IMPLEMENTATION

## Meta
- Date: 2025-04-29
- Priority: HIGH
- Target Component: Web Frontend
- Dependencies: None (standalone first demonstration)
- Estimated Time: 3-5 days

## Context

The StationThis web frontend needs to prioritize demonstration-driven development, focusing first on implementing the core canvas experience with testable, visible interactions before building out the complete system. Based on the updated Web Frontend North Star document, we need to shift toward interface-first thinking with small, testable chunks of functionality.

## Objective

Create a working demonstration of the canvas system with basic interactions that can be visually tested and validated. This serves as the foundation for the web interface and ensures alignment with the gamified, interactive vision.

## Requirements

### 1. Canvas Base Implementation
- Create a fullscreen canvas with the Gameboy-style water animation
- Implement basic panning (click and drag) and zooming (mouse wheel, pinch)
- Add a visible grid system that scales appropriately with zoom

### 2. Tile System Basics
- Create a sample workflow tile that can be placed on the canvas
- Implement dragging and resizing functionality for tiles
- Allow basic state representation (e.g., running, complete, error)
- Enable multiple tile instances on the canvas simultaneously

### 3. Authentication Modal
- Create a simple authentication modal with three options:
  - Login (form fields only, no backend connection yet)
  - Connect Wallet (button only, no actual wallet connection)
  - Continue as Guest (functional transition to canvas)
- Modal should be styled according to the Frontend Design Spec

### 4. Minimal HUD
- Implement a basic HUD in the upper left corner
- Include placeholder for username/guest tag
- Add simple style transitions (fade in/out on mouse movement)

## Implementation Approach

1. **Create a standalone demonstration page** - Build the implementation in a way that it can be viewed and tested independently
2. **Focus on visual elements first** - Ensure the water animation, tiles, and interactions look and feel right
3. **Use mock data** - No backend integration required for this phase
4. **Document interaction patterns** - Note any findings or challenges during implementation
5. **Test across devices** - Ensure the demonstration works on desktop and mobile views

## Testing Criteria

The implementation should allow testers to:
- Pan and zoom around the canvas
- Place, move, and resize workflow tiles
- View the authentication modal and enter the canvas as a guest
- See the minimal HUD elements

## Deliverables

1. A standalone HTML page demonstrating the canvas system
2. Supporting JavaScript modules implementing the core functionality
3. CSS for styling the canvas, tiles, and UI elements
4. A brief demonstration video showing the core interactions
5. Documentation of any challenges or findings during implementation

## Technical Guidelines

- Follow the architectural principles in the Web Frontend North Star document
- Use native DOM APIs and avoid heavy frameworks
- Optimize for performance, especially for animations and interactions
- Maintain clean separation between components for future integration
- Focus on demonstrable functionality over comprehensive implementation

## Next Steps After Completion

Once the demonstration is complete and validated:
1. Integrate with the main application structure
2. Connect authentication flow to backend services
3. Implement workspace persistence
4. Add workflow execution capabilities to tiles
