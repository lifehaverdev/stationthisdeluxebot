# HANDOFF: PHASE1-SESSION

## Work Completed
- Implemented the Session Service as the fifth core service
- Extracted session management logic from the global `lobby` object
- Created a clean, platform-agnostic interface for session management
- Implemented automatic session cleaning based on inactivity
- Added comprehensive error handling and documentation
- Enhanced with domain-specific functionality like points management and asset caching
- Updated PointsService to integrate with the SessionService
- Implemented event system for service coordination
- Updated progress tracking documents

## Current State

### Repository Structure
The Session Service has been added to the core services layer:

```
src/
  core/
    services/
      comfyui.js       # ComfyUI service
      points.js        # Points Service (updated to work with Session Service)
      workflows.js     # Workflows Service
      media.js         # Media Service
      session.js       # New Session Service implementation
      index.js         # Updated services index for easy importing
```

### Implementation Details

The Session Service provides the following capabilities:
- Managing user sessions in a platform-agnostic way
- Loading and saving session data to persistent storage
- Automatic cleanup of inactive sessions
- Methods for getting and setting session values
- Support for session persistence across restarts
- Point management including doints regeneration
- Asset caching with expiry times
- Event-based coordination with other services
- Batch operations on multiple user sessions

The service uses a clean OOP approach with:
- Public methods for the main functionality
- Private helper methods (prefixed with `_`) for internal operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Dependency injection for database access and analytics
- Configuration options for customization

The updated PointsService now:
- Interacts fully with the SessionService for all operations
- Listens for session events like "pointsReplenished" and "sessionCleaned"
- Falls back to database operations when SessionService is unavailable
- Uses the SessionService's point calculation methods

## Next Tasks
1. Complete integration with other services:
   - Update Workflows Service to use Session Service for user preferences
   - Link Media Service with Session Service for stateful operations

2. Begin Phase 2 implementation:
   - Start building platform-agnostic workflows layer
   - Connect workflows to core services
   - Implement state management

3. Consider adding platform adapters:
   - Create adapter for Telegram using existing bot structure
   - Prepare for Discord and web interface adapters

## Changes to Plan
No significant changes to the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md at this time. The implementation follows the planned simplified architecture.

## Open Questions

### 1. How should we handle session data synchronization across platforms?
Users may interact with the system through multiple platforms (Telegram, Discord, web). We need to decide how to handle synchronization of user preferences and state.

Options:
- Single source of truth with platform-specific views
- Platform-specific sessions with periodic synchronization
- Hybrid approach with core data shared and platform-specific extensions

**Recommendation**: Implement a single source of truth with platform-specific views. The Session Service should maintain core user data (points, preferences, etc.) while platform adapters handle platform-specific state. This approach minimizes data duplication and synchronization issues.

### 2. How should we handle session persistence during service restarts?
The current implementation loads sessions on demand but doesn't automatically restore all sessions on restart.

Options:
- Lazy loading (current approach)
- Eager loading of all active sessions on startup
- Hybrid approach with pre-loading of recently active sessions

**Recommendation**: Continue with the lazy loading approach for now, but consider adding a method to pre-load recently active sessions during service initialization. This approach balances memory usage with performance.

### 3. How should Session Service and Points Service collaborate on points replenishment?
**RESOLVED**: We've implemented an event-based system where:
- The SessionService handles the fundamental points replenishment logic
- It emits events that the PointsService can subscribe to
- Both services remain decoupled but coordinated
- The SessionService implements the core business logic for points management
- The PointsService focuses on domain-specific calculations and external interactions
