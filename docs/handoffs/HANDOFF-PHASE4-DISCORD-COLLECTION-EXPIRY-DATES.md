### Implementation Details

The Discord platform implementation follows these key design principles:
1. **Consistent user experience** - Standardized expiry options matching the web platform (1-90 days)
2. **Clear expiry information** - Formatted expiry date and days remaining prominently displayed
3. **Visual indicators** - Color highlighting for links close to expiry (3 days or less)
4. **Simple interactions** - Easy updating of expiry dates with dedicated modal and buttons

Key features implemented:
- Standard expiry options (1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 90 days) matching web platform
- Enhanced date formatting with localized date strings
- Visual warning (orange color) for links expiring within 3 days
- Validation of expiry inputs with sensible defaults
- Update mechanism for existing share link expiry dates

### User Flows

The implementation supports these key user flows:

1. **Creating a share link with expiry**:
   - User clicks "Create Share Link" button
   - Modal appears with expiry options dropdown
   - User selects expiry period and submits
   - System creates link with specified expiry
   - User receives rich embed with expiry information

2. **Viewing expiry information**:
   - Expiry date shown in formatted, human-readable form
   - Days remaining until expiry displayed
   - Color of embed indicates approaching expiry (orange if ≤3 days)

3. **Updating expiry for existing link**:
   - User clicks "Update Expiry" button on share link display
   - Modal appears with expiry options dropdown
   - User selects new expiry period and submits
   - System updates expiry date
   - User receives confirmation with updated expiry information

### Technical Details

The implementation uses Discord.js components:
- ModalBuilder for creating input forms
- TextInputBuilder for expiry input fields
- EmbedBuilder for displaying share links with expiry information
- ButtonBuilder for creating interactive buttons

API endpoints utilized:
- POST `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link` - Used with expiry parameter
- PATCH `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link/expiry` - Added for updating expiry dates

Core workflow methods:
- collectionsWorkflow.createShareLink() - Enhanced with standardized expiry handling
- collectionsWorkflow.updateShareLinkExpiry() - New method for updating existing links

## Next Steps
1. Add expiry date functionality to the Telegram platform
   - Implement inline keyboard options for setting/updating expiry
   - Add expiry date information to share link messages
   - Create command for modifying existing link expiry dates

2. Develop an expiry notification system
   - Create notification mechanism for links approaching expiry
   - Implement notifications across all platforms (web, Discord, Telegram)
   - Design graceful handling of expired links

3. Add admin features for bulk expiry management
   - Create interface for viewing all share links with expiry status
   - Implement bulk update capabilities for admins
   - Add reporting for expired/soon-to-expire links

4. Enhance analytics for link usage
   - Track link usage patterns in relation to expiry dates
   - Implement reporting on link renewals and expirations
   - Create insights for optimal expiry period recommendations

## Changes to Plan
No significant changes to the original plan. This implementation follows the next steps outlined in the previous handoff document (HANDOFF-PHASE4-COLLECTION-EXPIRY-DATES.md) by extending the expiry date functionality to the Discord platform.

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement automatic notifications before links expire across all platforms?
2. Is there a need for different expiry defaults based on user roles or collection types?
3. Should we add a feature to extend expiry dates automatically for frequently used links?

## Notes
This implementation completes an important enhancement to the Discord collection sharing system by adding time-based access control through expiry dates. The feature maintains consistency with the web platform implementation while adapting to Discord's unique UI requirements.

The implementation follows the platform-agnostic approach outlined in REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, with all core business logic for expiry dates in the shared CollectionsWorkflow class and only Discord-specific UI code in the platform adapter.

This feature directly contributes to the goal of making the platform more robust across all interfaces, ensuring that time-limited sharing works consistently regardless of which platform users prefer.
