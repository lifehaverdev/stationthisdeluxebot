# HANDOFF: 2025-06-16 - Telegram Command & Menu System Restoration

## Work Completed

-   **Dependency Injection Overhaul**: Traced and fixed the dependency injection issues plaguing all menu handlers. The `internalApiClient` is now consistently available as `dependencies.internal.client`.
-   **Static & Dynamic Commands Restored**:
    -   Fixed `/status` by adding the correct `/internal` API prefix.
    -   Fixed all dynamic commands (e.g., `/quickmake`) by adding `deploymentId` where required and refactoring the handler to use a flexible `serviceMap` instead of hardcoded `if/else` logic.
-   **Menu Commands Restored**: All primary menu commands (`/train`, `/settings`, `/mods`, `/spells`, `/cast`) have been fixed. They now correctly resolve `masterAccountId` via the internal API before proceeding.
-   **Callback & Reply System Fixed**:
    -   Standardized all callback handlers to a `(bot, callbackQuery, masterAccountId, dependencies)` signature, with `masterAccountId` resolved by the dispatcher.
    -   Fixed the `MessageReplyDispatcher` by registering the missing handler for `settings_param_edit`, making the parameter editing flow functional.
-   **Settings Menu Fully Repaired**:
    -   Resolved `BUTTON_DATA_INVALID` errors by using the tool's `displayName` in callback data, keeping it short and valid.
    -   Fixed `getToolSettings is not a function` by implementing local helper functions (`getToolSettings`, `saveToolSettings`) that use the internal API client.
    -   Corrected a lookup mismatch where a function expected a `displayName` but received a `toolId`.
-   **Spell Menu Repaired**:
    -   Fixed an issue preventing the spell editor menu from loading by removing double Markdown escaping.

## Current State

-   **All Core Telegram Features are Functional**: From a user's perspective, the bot's command and menu systems are fully operational again. `/status`, `/settings`, `/mods`, `/spells`, `/train`, `/cast`, and all dynamic commands work as expected.
-   **Stable Architecture**: The dependency injection and event dispatching architecture is now stable and consistent across the Telegram platform adapter.
-   **Settings Editing Works**: Users can now navigate the settings menu, view their custom-set parameter values on buttons, and successfully edit and save new values.

## Next Tasks

1.  **Full Regression Test**: Perform a thorough test of all Telegram features to ensure no new bugs were introduced during the extensive refactor.
2.  **Review Tweak Flow**: The "tweak" functionality in the settings menu was not fully tested. This flow should be reviewed to ensure it's still working correctly after the recent changes.
3.  **Cleanup**: Remove any temporary `console.log` or `logger.info` statements added for debugging purposes.
4.  **Consolidate Settings Logic**: Consider refactoring other menu managers to use the new `get/save` settings helpers from `settingsMenuManager.js` if they have similar functionality, to keep the code DRY.

## Open Questions

-   Are there any less-common menu flows or sub-menus that were not covered and might still have issues?
-   Does the "Tweak generation" flow need the same dependency injection and handler signature fixes that were applied elsewhere?
