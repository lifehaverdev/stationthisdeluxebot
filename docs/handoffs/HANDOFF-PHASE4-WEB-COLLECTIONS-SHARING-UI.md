### Implementation Details

The web collection sharing UI implementation follows these key design principles:
- Component-based architecture for UI encapsulation
- Store-based state management for cross-component communication
- Event delegation for efficient DOM interaction
- RESTful API integration with proper error handling

The main components are:

1. **Collection Sharing Component**:
   - User interface for sharing collections with specific users
   - Public share link generation and management
   - Existing shares management

2. **Shared Collections View**:
   - Grid view of collections shared with the current user
   - Owner information and permission indicators
   - Navigation to shared collection details

3. **Collection Detail Improvements**:
   - Sharing button for direct access to sharing interface
   - Shared status indicator
   - Conditional actions based on ownership

4. **Store Integration**:
   - Shared collections state management
   - Actions for managing shared collection data
   - Component-store communication pattern

### User Flows

The implementation supports these key user flows:

1. **Sharing a Collection**:
   - From collections grid: Click share button on collection card
   - From collection detail: Click share button in header
   - Enter username/email to share with
   - Generate a public share link with expiry

2. **Accessing Shared Collections**:
   - Via navigation: Click "Shared" in the navbar
   - View grid of collections shared with user
   - Click on a shared collection to view details

3. **Managing Shares**:
   - Remove specific users from shared collections
   - Delete share links to revoke access
   - View who has access to your collections

### Technical Requirements

This implementation relies on:
- The custom component system in `src/platforms/web/dom/`
- The store-based state management system
- The event-based routing system
- The existing collection sharing API endpoints

## Next Steps
1. Implement advanced sharing features
   - Role-based permissions (read, edit, admin)
   - Expiry dates for share links
   - Email notifications for new shares

2. Enhance user experience
   - Add toast notifications for successful actions
   - Implement inline validation for user inputs
   - Add loading indicators for async operations

3. Add component testing
   - Unit tests for component logic
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - Visual regression testing

## Notes
This implementation completes the UI portion of the web interface for collection sharing, providing feature parity with the Telegram and Discord implementations. The UI is designed to be intuitive and follows the design principles outlined in the WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR.md document.

The implementation follows the platform-agnostic approach outlined in REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, with all business logic remaining in the workflows layer and only UI-specific code in the web platform components. The UI components interact with the API endpoints documented in the previous handoff (HANDOFF-PHASE4-WEB-COLLECTIONS-SHARING.md).

The component architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements without requiring significant refactoring. The current implementation prioritizes a practical, working solution that follows the established patterns of the codebase.

During implementation, we identified some opportunities for UX improvements that could be addressed in future work, particularly around real-time feedback for user actions and more sophisticated permission management. These are documented in the Next Steps section above.

This completes the full-stack implementation of collection sharing for the web platform, bringing it to feature parity with the Telegram and Discord platforms and furthering the project's goal of a unified, platform-agnostic service.
