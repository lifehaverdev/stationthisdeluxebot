# HANDOFF: PHASE3-DISCORD-ADAPTER

## Work Completed

1. Created the base Discord adapter structure following the platform adapter pattern:
   - Created `src/platforms/discord/index.js` entry point
   - Created `src/platforms/discord/bot.js` for Discord bot initialization and event handling
   - Created `src/platforms/discord/mediaAdapter.js` for Discord-specific media operations
   - Created `src/platforms/discord/commands/makeImageCommand.js` as an example command handler

2. Added Discord initialization to the platforms layer in `src/platforms/index.js`

## Current State

The Discord adapter implementation has begun with the foundational structure in place:

1. Core initialization logic is implemented:
   - Bot configuration with necessary intents
   - Slash command registration
   - Event handlers for commands and button interactions
   - Media handling through the platform adapter

2. The makeImage command is implemented:
   - Connects to the same platform-agnostic makeImageWorkflow
   - Properly handles Discord interactions and responses
   - Includes regenerate and upscale buttons with customId handlers

3. Missing command implementations:
   - Upscale
   - Settings
   - Collections
   - Train
   - Button interactions for regenerate/upscale are stubbed out

## Next Tasks

1. Implement remaining command handlers:
   - `src/platforms/discord/commands/upscaleCommand.js`
   - `src/platforms/discord/commands/settingsCommand.js`
   - `src/platforms/discord/commands/collectionsCommand.js`
   - `src/platforms/discord/commands/trainModelCommand.js`

2. Complete button interaction handling:
   - Complete regenerate feature
   - Complete upscale feature
   - Implement settings buttons
   - Implement collections buttons
   - Implement train model buttons

3. Connect Discord adapter to workflows:
   - Ensure all commands properly utilize the platform-agnostic workflows
   - Test platform-specific features like reactions and embeds

4. Add environment configuration:
   - Update env examples
   - Add Discord bot configuration to startup

5. Create progress tracking document for Discord adapter

## Changes to Plan

No significant changes to the original plan. The Discord adapter implementation is following the same pattern as the Telegram adapter, but with Discord-specific interaction patterns:

1. Using slash commands instead of text commands
2. Using Discord interactions for responses
3. Using Discord ActionRow and Button components for interactive elements
4. Adapting to Discord's ephemeral messages and interaction model

## Open Questions

1. **Testing Strategy**: How should we test the Discord adapter? Should we create a test server or use a mock client?
2. **Button Components**: How should we standardize button components across platforms? Currently, we're adapting Telegram's inline keyboard format to Discord's buttons.
3. **Media Handling**: Are there any Discord-specific media formats or limitations we need to account for?
4. **Authentication**: How should we handle user authentication and session management for Discord users?

## Implementation Notes

The Discord adapter follows the same architectural pattern as the Telegram adapter. All platform-specific code is isolated in the adapter, while business logic remains in the platform-agnostic workflows.

Key differences in implementation:

1. Discord uses interactions rather than messages, requiring a different handling pattern
2. Discord has built-in commands infrastructure (slash commands)
3. Discord uses a different component system for buttons and other interactive elements

The implementation maintains feature parity with the Telegram bot while leveraging Discord-specific features where appropriate.
