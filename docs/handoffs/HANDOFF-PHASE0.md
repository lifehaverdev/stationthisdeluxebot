# HANDOFF: PHASE0

## Work Completed
- Moved old src/ directory to archive/src/ for preservation
- Created new simplified directory structure in src/
- Conducted review of archived codebase
- Created inventory of reusable components
- Documented lessons learned and recommendations

## Current State

### Documentation Created
- [Code Review](../progress/phase0/code_review.md) - Analysis of archived codebase
- [Component Inventory](../progress/phase0/component_inventory.md) - Reusable components
- [ADR-001](../decisions/ADR-001-simplified-architecture.md) - Simplified architecture decision

## Next Tasks
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation:
   - Create ComfyUI service as first core service
   - Extract core functionality from `archive/src/core/generation` and `utils/bot/queue.js`
   - Implement a simplified interface

2. Update progress tracking:
   - Update `docs/progress/phase1/services_status.md` as work progresses
   - Create new ADRs for significant decisions

3. Prepare for platform adaptation:
   - Analyze Telegram bot implementation in utils/bot/
   - Plan migration path for platform adapter

## Changes to Plan
No significant changes to the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md at this time. The review confirmed that the simplified architecture approach is appropriate.

## Open Questions
1. How deeply should we integrate with existing MongoDB models?
   - Based on code review, a hybrid approach is recommended
   - Reuse existing models where they work well, simplify where necessary

2. Should we introduce TypeScript gradually or maintain JavaScript?
   - Based on code review, recommend sticking with JavaScript for now
   - Add JSDoc types for clarity without adding TypeScript complexity

3. How should we handle the transition period when both systems are active?
   - Based on code review, recommend a service-by-service migration
   - Start with core services that can work alongside existing code
