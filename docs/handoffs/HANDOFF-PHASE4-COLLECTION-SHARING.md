### Implementation Details

The collection sharing implementation follows these key design principles:
- Permissions-based access control (view vs. edit)
- Platform-agnostic sharing protocol
- Separation of sharing business logic from UI
- Support for both direct sharing and link-based sharing

The main components are:

1. **Collection Workflow Enhancement**:
   - `shareCollection`: Share with specific users
   - `unshareCollection`: Remove sharing
   - `updateSharePermissions`: Change permissions for a shared user
   - `createShareLink`: Generate time-limited share links
   - `getCollectionByShareToken`: Retrieve collections by share link
   - Enhanced `getCollection` to handle shared access

2. **Database Operations**:
   - Added query methods for shared collections
   - Implemented token-based share link storage
   - Created operations for managing shares

3. **Discord UI Components**:
   - Sharing buttons and modals
   - Share management interface
   - Shared collections listing

### Usage Examples

#### Sharing a Collection with Another User
Using the "Share Collection" button, users can enter another user's Discord ID and set permissions.

#### Creating a Share Link
Using the "Create Share Link" button, users can generate a link with custom expiry and permissions.

#### Managing Shares
The "Manage Shares" button allows reviewing current shares and changing/removing access.

#### Viewing Shared Collections
The `/collections shared` command displays all collections shared with the current user.

## Next Steps
1. Implement enhanced video thumbnail generation
   - Add proper frame extraction using ffmpeg
   - Optimize video thumbnail caching
   - Implement thumbnail storage and caching

2. Implement platform-specific sharing adapters
   - Create Telegram UI for collection sharing
   - Develop web interface sharing components
   - Ensure cross-platform share link compatibility

3. Add advanced sharing features
   - Group-based sharing
   - Role-based permissions
   - Share activity tracking

## Notes
This implementation completes the collection sharing functionality that was identified as the next priority in the previous handoff document. The sharing system has been designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements like group sharing and more granular permissions.

The implementation follows the clean architecture principles from REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, maintaining separation between platform-specific code and business logic. All sharing-related business logic is contained within the workflow layer, while platform-specific UI is isolated to the Discord adapter.

Note that while the Discord UI for sharing has been fully implemented, the Telegram and Web interfaces still need to be developed. However, the core sharing functionality is platform-agnostic and can be easily integrated with these interfaces when they are developed.
