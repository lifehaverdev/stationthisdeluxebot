# HANDOFF: PHASE4-COLLECTION-EXPIRY-DATES

## Work Completed
- Implemented expiry date functionality for collection share links:
  - Added expiry date selection when creating share links
  - Added display of current expiry date and days remaining for existing links
  - Implemented updating expiry date for existing links
  - Added visual indication when links are close to expiry (color coding)
  - Enhanced UI with appropriate form controls and feedback
- Updated the CollectionSharingComponent with:
  - State management for expiry dates
  - API integration for expiry date functionality
  - Improved UI for expiry date selection and modification
  - Feedback mechanisms for expiry date actions

## Current State

    HANDOFF-PHASE4-COLLECTION-EXPIRY-DATES.md   # This document
```

### Implementation Details

The collection sharing expiry dates enhancement follows these key design principles:
1. **User-friendly date selection** - Simple dropdown for common expiry periods (1-90 days)
2. **Clear expiry information** - Formatted expiry date and days remaining prominently displayed
3. **Visual indicators** - Color highlighting for links close to expiry (3 days or less)
4. **Simplified interactions** - Easy updating of expiry dates with immediate feedback

Key features implemented:
- Default 7-day expiry with options for 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days
- Calculation and display of days remaining until expiry
- Warning colors for expiry dates within 3 days
- Ability to modify expiry dates for existing links
- Success notifications for all expiry-related actions

### User Flows

The implementation supports these key user flows:

1. **Creating a share link with expiry**:
   - Select expiry period from dropdown
   - Create link
   - Receive success notification
   - See expiry date information

2. **Viewing expiry information**:
   - See formatted expiry date
   - See days remaining until expiry
   - Receive visual warning when expiry is approaching (â‰¤3 days)

3. **Updating expiry for existing link**:
   - Select new expiry period from dropdown
   - Update expiry
   - Receive success notification
   - See updated expiry information

### Technical Details

This implementation leverages:
- The custom component system in accordance with WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR.md
- State management for tracking expiry options and current expiry
- Date formatting and calculation for user-friendly display
- Visual feedback for approaching expiry dates
- The existing API structure with minor extensions

API endpoints used:
- GET `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link/status` - Enhanced to return expiry date
- POST `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link` - Used with expiryDays parameter
- PATCH `/api/share/collection/:collectionId/link/expiry` - Added for updating expiry dates

## Next Steps
1. Implement administrator features (as outlined in previous handoff)
   - Design and implement permission audit logs
   - Create bulk permission management interface
   - Develop permission templates for common sharing scenarios

2. Add expiry date functionality to the Discord platform
   - Implement commands for setting/viewing share link expiry
   - Add expiry date information to link generation
   - Create equivalent UI feedback for the Discord platform

3. Add expiry date functionality to the Telegram platform
   - Add expiry date parameter to share command
   - Display expiry information in share link messages
   - Implement expiry date modification commands

4. Develop an expiry notification system
   - Create notification mechanism for links approaching expiry
   - Implement email notifications for link owners
   - Add in-app notifications for expiring links

## Changes to Plan
No significant changes to the original plan. This implementation follows the next steps outlined in the previous handoff document (HANDOFF-PHASE4-COLLECTION-PERMISSIONS-FEEDBACK.md) by implementing the expiry dates for share links feature.

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement automatic renewal options for frequently used share links?
2. How should expired links be handled - completely remove access or show a specific expired message?
3. Should we implement different default expiry periods based on permission levels?

## Notes
This implementation completes an important enhancement to the collection sharing system by adding time-based access control through expiry dates. This feature improves security by ensuring that shared links don't provide indefinite access unless explicitly intended.

The implementation follows the platform-agnostic approach outlined in REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, with all business logic related to expiry dates contained in shared workflows and only UI-specific code in the web platform components.

The feature directly contributes to the goal of making the platform more robust and flexible, particularly for enterprise use cases where time-limited sharing is an important security consideration.

The UI implementation is designed to be intuitive and follows the principles in WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR.md, with clear visual feedback and a streamlined user experience.
