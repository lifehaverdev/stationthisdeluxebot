# HANDOFF: PHASE3-DISCORD-TRAIN-MODEL

## Work Completed
- Implemented train model command handler for Discord
- Created functionality for creating, viewing, and managing training datasets
- Implemented image upload and caption functionality
- Connected to the platform-agnostic trainModel workflow
- Added interactive components (buttons, modals) for user interaction
- Updated Discord bot to register and handle train model interactions

## Current State

### Repository Structure
The Discord platform adapter now includes the following components related to model training:

```
src/
  platforms/
    discord/
      commands/
        trainModelCommand.js   # NEW: Train model command handler for Discord
      bot.js                   # Updated to register train model command
  workflows/
    trainModel.js             # Platform-agnostic train model workflow (previously implemented)
```

### Implementation Details

The Train Model Command Handler for Discord provides the following capabilities:
- Listing all user training datasets with interactive buttons
- Creating new training datasets with a name
- Viewing detailed information about specific datasets
- Uploading images with captions for training
- Starting the model training process

The implementation follows the Discord.js best practices:
- Slash command structure with subcommands
- Interactive UI using embeds, buttons, and modals
- Consistent error handling and user feedback
- Clean separation between command handling and interaction handling

Key features:
- Subcommand structure: `/train list`, `/train create`, `/train view`, etc.
- Rich embeds for displaying dataset information
- Interactive buttons for common actions
- Modal forms for data input
- Complete integration with platform-agnostic workflow

### Discord-Specific Adaptations

1. **Slash Commands**: Using Discord's structured slash command system with subcommands
2. **Rich Embeds**: Using Discord's embed system for formatted messages
3. **Interactive Components**: Using Discord's buttons for user actions
4. **Modal Forms**: Using Discord's modal system for data input 
5. **Image Attachments**: Using Discord's attachment system for image uploads

## Usage Examples

### List Training Datasets
```
/train list
```
This shows all user training datasets with buttons to view, upload images, or start training.

### Create Dataset
```
/train create name:MyCustomModel
```
Creates a new training dataset with the specified name.

### View Dataset
```
/train view id:dataset_id
```
Shows detailed information about a specific dataset including image count and status.

### Upload Image
```
/train upload id:dataset_id image:[attachment] caption:A detailed description of the image
```
Uploads an image to the training dataset with the specified caption.

### Start Training
```
/train start id:dataset_id
```
Begins the training process for the specified dataset.

## Interaction Flow

1. User creates a new dataset using `/train create`
2. System creates dataset and returns confirmation with buttons
3. User uploads images using `/train upload` or through button interactions
4. User provides captions for each image
5. When enough images are uploaded, user starts training with `/train start`
6. System validates images, checks points balance, and starts training
7. User receives notification when training completes

## Next Steps

1. Add support for additional training parameters
   - Training epochs
   - Learning rate
   - Model type selection

2. Implement dataset sharing functionality
   - Allow users to share datasets with other users
   - Permissions management for shared datasets

3. Add training progress monitoring
   - Real-time status updates
   - ETA calculations
   - Interrupt/cancel training option

4. Enhance error handling
   - More detailed error messages
   - Recovery options for failed uploads
   - Automatic retries for transient errors
