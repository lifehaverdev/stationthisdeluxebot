## Work Completed
- Implemented item editing functionality for collections:
  - Added `editItemInCollection` method to Collections workflow
  - Added `/collections edititem` subcommand to Discord collections command
  - Created UI components for item editing including:
    - Edit Item button in collection items view
    - Modal form for item property editing
    - Confirmation message after updates
  - Connected Discord UI to the new editItemInCollection workflow
  - Enhanced item display with edit buttons for each item
  - Updated progress tracking documentation

### Implementation Details

The collection item editing feature implements:
- A dedicated slash command for editing items: `/collections edititem id:<collection_id> itemid:<item_id> [type:<type>] [url:<url>] [description:<description>]`
- An "Edit Item" button in the collection items view
- A modal form for editing item properties
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Consistent UI patterns with other Discord commands

The implementation follows the platform-agnostic approach where:
- Business logic remains in the workflow layer (`editItemInCollection`)
- UI-specific code is isolated to the platform adapter (Discord)
- Error handling occurs at both layers appropriately

### Usage Examples

#### Edit Item via Slash Command
```
/collections edititem id:collectionId itemid:itemId type:new-type url:new-url description:new-description
```
This directly edits the specified item properties.

#### Edit Item via Button
1. Use `/collections items id:collectionId` to view items
2. Click the "Edit Item" button next to the item you want to edit
3. Update the item properties in the modal that appears
4. Item is updated with confirmation

## Next Steps
1. Implement item thumbnail generation
   - Add preview thumbnails for items in collections
   - Support different thumbnail types based on item type

2. Implement collection sharing
   - Add ability to share collections between users
   - Implement permissions model for shared collections

## Notes
This implementation completes another step in building out the collections management functionality. The item editing feature was implemented following the clean architecture principles from REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md, maintaining separation between platform-specific code and business logic.

The workflow method `editItemInCollection` has been designed to be platform-agnostic, making it easy to implement similar UI functionality for other platforms like Telegram and Web in the future.

Testing has confirmed that the item editing functionality works correctly, with proper validation, error handling, and user feedback. Users can now fully manage their collection contents through adding, viewing, editing, and removing items.
