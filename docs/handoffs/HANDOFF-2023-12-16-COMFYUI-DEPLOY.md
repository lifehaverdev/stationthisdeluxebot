# HANDOFF: 2023-12-16 - ComfyUI Deploy Integration

## Work Completed

### Core Services Refactoring

1. **Enhanced ComfyUI Service** (`src/core/services/comfyui.js`)
   - Added comprehensive API client capabilities for ComfyUI Deploy
   - Implemented all critical endpoints: run, workflow, deployment, machine, upload
   - Added webhook support for real-time status updates
   - Improved error handling with retry mechanism
   - Added file upload functionality via pre-signed URLs

2. **Refactored Workflows Service** (`src/core/services/workflows.js`)
   - Switched to ComfyUI Deploy API as primary source of truth
   - Implemented efficient caching with proper TTL and invalidation
   - Added database fallback for offline operation
   - Enhanced workflow parsing to extract input requirements
   - Added machine management functionality
   - Built lookup indexes for efficient workflow and deployment access

3. **Documentation**
   - Created integration plan (`docs/handoffs/COMFYUI_DEPLOY_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`)
   - Updated progress tracking (`docs/progress/comfyui-deploy-integration.md`)
   - Created this handoff document

## Current State

1. **API Integration**
   - Primary ComfyUI Deploy API endpoints are now fully integrated
   - Core architecture has been refactored to use API as source of truth
   - Caching mechanisms are in place for performance optimization
   - Added database fallback for resilience

2. **Feature Status**
   - Core API client integration ✅
   - Workflow management ✅ 
   - Machine management ✅
   - File handling 🟠 (partially implemented, needs media service updates)
   - Platform adapter updates ❌ (not started)

## Next Tasks

In order of priority:

1. **Media Service Updates** (`src/core/services/media.js`)
   - Integrate with ComfyUI Deploy file upload endpoints
   - Implement pre-signed URL support for uploads
   - Add image download handlers for ComfyUI Deploy URLs
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed media

2. **Workflow Implementation**
   - Update `makeImage.js` to use enhanced ComfyUI service
   - Add proper error handling and progress tracking
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for API failures

3. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive tests for API integration
   - Validate error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Test performance under load conditions

4. **Platform Adapters**
   - Update Telegram and Discord command handlers
   - Modify rendering for ComfyUI Deploy-specific outputs
   - Add new features enabled by direct API integration

## Changes to Plan

The original refactoring plan has been enhanced to focus more directly on ComfyUI Deploy integration:

1. **Increased API Reliance**
   - Greater focus on using ComfyUI Deploy as the primary source of truth
   - Reduced reliance on local database except for caching and fallback
   - Added more extensive API client capabilities than initially planned

2. **Enhanced Resilience**
   - Added robust retry mechanisms for API calls
   - Implemented more comprehensive error handling
   - Added database fallback for offline operation
   - Created caching strategies to reduce API load

## Open Questions

1. **Webhook Configuration**
   - How should webhook URLs be configured in different environments?
   - Do we need to implement a local webhook handler to process updates?

2. **Authentication Management**
   - What's the best approach for managing API keys securely?
   - Do we need to implement token refresh mechanisms?

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - What's the optimal TTL for different types of cached data?
   - Should we use memory caching, database caching, or both?

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - How do we handle potential API rate limits?
   - Should we implement adaptive retry delays?

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Purpose | Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `/api/run` (GET/POST) | Run workflows and get results | ComfyUIService.submitRequest(), checkStatus() |
| `/api/upload-url` | Generate pre-signed URLs | ComfyUIService.getUploadUrl() |
| `/api/workflow` | Upload workflow definitions | ComfyUIService.uploadWorkflow() |
| `/api/workflow-version/:id` | Get workflow details | WorkflowsService.getWorkflowVersion() |
| `/api/deployment` | List and create deployments | WorkflowsService._fetchAndProcessDeployments(), ComfyUIService.createDeployment() |
| `/api/machine` | List registered machines | WorkflowsService.getMachines() |

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **API URL Handling**
   - The code carefully handles API path construction to prevent duplicate "/api" segments
   - Both services implement consistent URL formatting for endpoints

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented progressive retries with exponential backoff
   - Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
   - Graceful fallback to cached data when possible

3. **Caching**
   - In-memory caching with configurable TTL
   - Index structures for efficient lookups
   - Selective invalidation for specific entities

4. **Database Fallback**
   - Optional database integration for caching and fallback
   - Workflow service can load from database if API is unavailable

## Example Usage

### Generating an Image with ComfyUI Deploy

```javascript
// Initialize services
const comfyuiService = new ComfyUIService({
  apiKey: process.env.COMFY_DEPLOY_API_KEY
});

const workflowsService = new WorkflowsService({
  apiKey: process.env.COMFY_DEPLOY_API_KEY
});

// Get a workflow by name
const workflow = await workflowsService.getWorkflowByName('text2image');

// Select a deployment
const deploymentId = workflow.deploymentIds[0];

// Prepare inputs
const inputs = {
  input_prompt: 'A beautiful mountain landscape',
  input_negative_prompt: 'ugly, blurry'
};

// Submit the request
const runId = await comfyuiService.submitRequest({
  deploymentId,
  inputs
});

// Check status until complete
let complete = false;
while (!complete) {
  const status = await comfyuiService.checkStatus(runId);
  
  if (status.status === 'completed' || status.status === 'error') {
    complete = true;
    
    if (status.status === 'completed') {
      // Get the results
      const results = await comfyuiService.getResults(runId);
      console.log('Generated images:', results.images);
    }
  } else {
    console.log(`Progress: ${status.progress * 100}%`);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
  }
}
```

### Uploading a File

```javascript
// Get a pre-signed URL
const uploadInfo = await comfyuiService.getUploadUrl({
  type: 'image/png',
  fileSize: fileBuffer.length
});

// Upload the file
const result = await comfyuiService.uploadFile({
  uploadUrl: uploadInfo.upload_url,
  fileData: fileBuffer,
  contentType: 'image/png'
});

console.log('Uploaded file URL:', uploadInfo.download_url);
```
