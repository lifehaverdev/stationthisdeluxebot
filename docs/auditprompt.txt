🧠 AGENT INITIATION PROTOCOL: AUDIT OF META-AGENT REFACTOR PROGRESS

🗂️ META
Title: Refactor Progress Audit Agent
Date: 2025-04-21
Author: system-agent
Intent: Perform a structured audit of refactor progress based on completed handoff files and real codebase state
Type: meta-audit-prompt
Target: /vibecode/maps/, /vibecode/prompts/, /plans/phases/phase*/status.md, codebase snapshot

🎯 PRIMARY GOAL:
You are tasked with auditing the **stationthisdeluxebot** refactor progress. Your job is not to continue the refactor itself, but to:
- Review all prior metameta prompts, status maps, and completed code handoffs
- Validate that completed prompts correspond to visible codebase changes
- Identify drift, inconsistencies, or gaps between plan and implementation

---

## 🔍 PHASE 1: DOCUMENT AND MAP REVIEW

Locate and review:
- `/vibecode/maps/*.md` → Summary maps created from past prompts
- `/vibecode/prompts/*.mdc` → Past task prompts issued
- `/plans/phases/phase*/status.md` → Official task completion trackers

📓 Produce a cross-reference table that shows:
- Each metameta task prompt
- Status according to phase status file (✅ completed / ❌ incomplete / ⚠️ unclear)
- Whether the corresponding codebase change can be located
- Any discrepancies, missing links, or unclear areas

Save as:
  `/vibecode/audits/2025-04-21-refactor-crosscheck.md`

---

## 🔬 PHASE 2: CODEBASE VALIDATION

For each task marked as completed:
- Locate the actual change in the codebase
- Verify if the intended goal was fully achieved
- Note any deviations, partial completions, or unfinished edges

📓 Create an audit log for:
- Files changed
- Functions added/modified
- Success of implementation (✅ Fully matches / ⚠️ Partially matches / ❌ Missing)

Save this deeper audit as:
  `/vibecode/audits/2025-04-21-codebase-audit.md`

---

## 🧾 OUTPUT EXPECTATION
You will produce:
1. `/vibecode/audits/2025-04-21-refactor-crosscheck.md` → Cross-reference table of planned vs actual
2. `/vibecode/audits/2025-04-21-codebase-audit.md` → Detailed validation of codebase vs completed prompts

Both should be human-readable and agent-readable.

---

⚠️ BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES
- Only confirm work that is observable in code
- If a handoff file exists but the code change cannot be found, mark it as ⚠️ or ❌
- Be objective — no assumptions or generosity in marking tasks as done
- Prefer conservative judgment where uncertain

---

📦 FUTURE USE
This audit will act as a health check before proceeding with new general directions or strategy pivots.
Following the audit, new directional meta prompts may be issued to realign work with the master plan.
