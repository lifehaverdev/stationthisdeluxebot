## Implementation Approach

The Data Flow Enhancements were implemented following the practical approach outlined in the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN:

1. **Core Type System**
   - Created a DataTypeValidator module for handling type compatibility
   - Implemented practical type conversion functions
   - Added descriptive error messaging for incompatible connections
   - Integrated with the existing connection system

2. **User Experience Focus**
   - Added clear error messages for incompatible connections
   - Provided helpful suggestions for resolving type mismatches
   - Implemented automatic type conversion for compatible types
   - Added debug logging for data transformation

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**

   - Enhanced WorkflowTileComponent to handle data conversion
   - Updated PipelineExecutionSystem to support port type requests
   - Improved data propagation between connected workflows

## Testing Instructions

To test the Data Flow Enhancements:

1. Create multiple workflow tiles of different types
2. Connect them by clicking on output ports and then input ports
3. Observe validation messages when connecting incompatible ports
4. Connect compatible ports and observe successful connections
5. Execute the pipeline by right-clicking and selecting "Execute Pipeline"
6. Check the console logs to see data type conversions
7. Verify that data flows correctly between connected workflows

## Implementation Notes

The data flow enhancements focus on creating a robust, user-friendly system for handling data types in the pipeline. The implementation includes:

1. **Type Validation System**
   - Comprehensive port type definitions
   - Validation during connection creation
   - Clear error messages for incompatible types
   - Helpful suggestions for resolving type mismatches

2. **Data Conversion System**
   - Automatic conversion between compatible types
   - Explicit conversion functions for common type pairs
   - Graceful handling of conversion failures
   - Debug logging for tracking conversions

3. **User Feedback**
   - Clear notification messages for validation errors
   - Suggestions for resolving type mismatches
   - Visual indicators for incompatible connections
   - Pipeline execution status updates

The next phase will focus on implementing the pipeline management features, including template saving, performance metrics, and preset libraries.
