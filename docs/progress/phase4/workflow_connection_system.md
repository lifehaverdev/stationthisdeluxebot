   - [x] SVG-based connection visualization layer
   - [x] User interaction for creating connections
   - [x] Connection validation logic
   - [x] Connection deletion
   - [x] Context menu for connection management
   - [x] Integration with canvas zoom/pan operations
   - [x] Connection persistence through workspace saving

2. **WorkflowTileComponent Extensions**
   - [x] Input/output port definitions for different workflow types
   - [x] Port rendering and interaction
   - [x] Data input/output handling
   - [x] Execution with connected input data
   - [x] Propagation of output data to connected tiles

3. **CanvasComponent Integration**
   - [x] Connection system initialization
   - [x] Event handling for connection operations
   - [x] Connection persistence in workspace save/load
   - [x] Connection deletion through context menu

4. **CSS Styling**
   - [x] Connection ports styling
   - [x] Connection paths styling
   - [x] Connection highlighting and selection
   - [x] Context menu styling

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation follows the architectural principles from the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN:

1. **Platform Adapters**
   - Connection system implemented in the web platform directory
   - UI components follow the lean frontend architecture in WEB_FRONTEND_NORTH_STAR.md
   - No React dependencies, using native DOM APIs and SVG

2. **Core Services Integration**
   - Connection system connects to workflow execution through the EventBus
   - Authentication integration for workspace persistence
   - Points system integration for workflow execution costs

3. **Practical Implementation**
   - Simple, intuitive visual representation of connections
   - Clear port labeling and data type indicators
   - Contextual validation for connection creation

## Current Status

The workflow connection system is fully implemented and supports:

- Creating connections between workflow tiles by clicking on ports
- Visual feedback for valid connection points
- Contextual validation of connections (type matching, preventing cycles)
- Persistence of connections through workspace save/load
- Execution of workflow pipelines with data flowing between tiles

## Next Steps

1. **Data Transformation**
   - Implement data transformation between different port types
   - Add conversion utilities for common data types
   - Create interface for configuring transformations

2. **Pipeline Execution**
   - Implement sequential and parallel execution of connected workflows
   - Add execution control tools (run all, pause, reset)
   - Provide visual feedback during pipeline execution

3. **Connection Presets**
   - Create preset connection configurations for common workflows
   - Add a library of connection templates
   - Implement drag-and-drop pipeline creation

## Implementation Approach

The workflow connection system was implemented following a practical approach:

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Basic connection creation implemented first
   - Visual styling and feedback added incrementally
   - Advanced features built on stable foundation

2. **User-Focused Design**
   - Clear visual indicators for connection ports
   - Intuitive interaction pattern (click source, click target)
   - Contextual feedback for valid/invalid connections

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - SVG used for efficient rendering of connections
   - Connection system updates only when necessary
   - Lazy evaluation of connection validity

## Testing Instructions

To test the workflow connection system:

1. Create two or more workflow tiles of different types
2. Click on an output port of one tile to start a connection
3. Notice how valid input ports on other tiles are highlighted
4. Click on a valid input port to complete the connection
5. Execute the workflow with the input port to see data flow
6. Click on a connection to see the context menu
7. Delete a connection using the context menu
8. Refresh the page to verify connection persistence

## Notes and Considerations

- The connection system assumes the existence of API endpoints for workflow execution
- Data flow between tiles requires proper serialization/deserialization of data
- Connection persistence requires authenticated users
- Complex workflow pipelines may require optimization for execution order

## Next Phase Considerations

For future phases:

1. **Advanced Routing**
   - Implement conditional connections based on workflow results
   - Add branching and merging of workflow paths
   - Create loop constructs for iterative processing

2. **Connection Visualization**
   - Enhance connection styling based on data types
   - Add animation for data flow during execution
   - Implement connection status indicators

3. **Collaborative Features**
   - Enable real-time connection editing for multiple users
   - Add permissions for connection manipulation
   - Implement version control for connection configurations
