### 4. Collections Workflow
**Status**: Implemented & Tested  
**Source Files**: Collection management in `utils/bot/handlers/iCollection.js`  
**Target File**: `src/workflows/collections.js`  
**Test Files**: `tests/integration/collections-workflow.test.js`  
**Dependencies**: Session Service, Media Service

### 5. Settings Workflow
**Status**: Implemented & Tested  
**Source Files**: Settings commands in `utils/bot/handlers/iSettings.js`  
**Target File**: `src/workflows/settings.js`  
**Test Files**: `tests/integration/settings-workflow.test.js`  
**Dependencies**: Session Service  
**Description**: Handles user preference management  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented platform-agnostic settings management
- Added comprehensive validation for all setting types
- Created balance-based calculation of limits (size, batch, steps)
- Implemented single-setting and bulk-setting update operations
- Added reset functionality to restore defaults
- Created consistent response format with success/error handling
- Implemented thorough unit testing of all functionality
- Used dependency injection for services and logging

## Testing Status

### 1. Workflow Tests
**Status**: Expanding Implementation
**Test Files**: 
- `tests/integration/makeImage-workflow.test.js`
- `tests/integration/trainModel-workflow.test.js`
- `tests/integration/collections-workflow.test.js`
- `tests/integration/settings-workflow.test.js`
**Description**: Integration tests for workflows
**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented comprehensive testing for makeImage workflow
- Implemented comprehensive testing for trainModel workflow
- Implemented comprehensive testing for collections workflow
- Implemented comprehensive testing for settings workflow
- Created custom mocking functionality for all services
- Verified proper integration between workflows and services
- Tested both success and error handling paths
- Tests use specific user ID (5472638766) as requested
- Additional workflow tests will be added as workflows are implemented

## Integration Notes
- All workflows should follow a consistent pattern with dependency injection
- Platform-specific code should be removed from workflows
- Error handling should be comprehensive with appropriate responses
- Workflows should not directly modify platform-specific objects
