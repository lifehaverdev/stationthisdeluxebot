# Phase 2: Workflows Status

## Overview
This document tracks the status of platform-agnostic workflows being implemented as part of Phase 2.

## Workflows

### 1. Media Processing Workflow
**Status**: Implemented  
**Source Files**: Original media handling in `utils/bot/handlers/iMedia.js`  
**Target File**: `src/workflows/mediaProcessing.js`  
**Dependencies**: Media Service  
**Description**: Handles processing of media files across platforms  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Provides functions for common media processing operations
- Handles image resizing and format conversion
- Simulates background removal and upscaling
- Includes error handling and result formatting
- Needs refinement to remove platform-specific code

### 2. Make Image Workflow
**Status**: Implemented & Tested  
**Source Files**: Image generation in `utils/bot/commands/make.js`  
**Target File**: `src/workflows/makeImage.js`  
**Test Files**: `tests/integration/makeImage-workflow.test.js`  
**Dependencies**: ComfyUI Service, Points Service, Session Service, Media Service  
**Description**: Handles the complete image generation process  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Implements the complete flow from prompt to delivery
- Handles point calculation and management
- Integrates with user preferences via Session Service
- Includes workflow selection and parameter preparation
- Processes and saves generated images
- Tracks generation history in user session
- Implements comprehensive error handling
- Comprehensive tests verify integration with all services
- Tests include both happy path and error scenarios

### 3. Train Model Workflow
**Status**: Not Started  
**Source Files**: Model training in `utils/bot/commands/train.js`  
**Target File**: `src/workflows/trainModel.js`  
**Dependencies**: ComfyUI Service, Points Service, Session Service, Media Service  
**Description**: Handles the model training process  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Planned for future implementation

### 4. Collections Workflow
**Status**: Not Started  
**Source Files**: Collection management in various command files  
**Target File**: `src/workflows/collections.js`  
**Dependencies**: Session Service, Media Service  
**Description**: Handles user collections of images and models  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Planned for future implementation

### 5. Settings Workflow
**Status**: Not Started  
**Source Files**: Settings commands in `utils/bot/commands/settings.js`  
**Target File**: `src/workflows/settings.js`  
**Dependencies**: Session Service  
**Description**: Handles user preference management  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Planned for future implementation

## Testing Status

### 1. Workflow Tests
**Status**: Initial Implementation
**Test Files**: `tests/integration/makeImage-workflow.test.js`
**Description**: Integration tests for workflows
**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented comprehensive testing for makeImage workflow
- Created custom mocking functionality for all services
- Verified proper integration between workflow and services
- Tested both success and error handling paths
- Test uses specific user ID (5472638766) as requested
- Additional workflow tests will be added as workflows are implemented

## Integration Notes
- All workflows should follow a consistent pattern with dependency injection
- Platform-specific code should be removed from workflows
- Error handling should be comprehensive with appropriate responses
- Workflows should not directly modify platform-specific objects 

## Current Task
- âœ… **Completed Task**: Implement a test script to verify workflow functionality
  - Created a comprehensive test script that initializes the system
  - Loaded workflows from the database
  - Simulated a user (userId: 5472638766) generating an image
  - Verified all services are correctly integrated
  - Tested error handling and edge cases
  
- **Next Priority**: Continue implementing additional Phase 2 workflows
