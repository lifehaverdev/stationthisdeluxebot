# Phase 1: Blockers and Issues

## Current Blockers
None identified yet.

## Open Questions
1. How deeply should we integrate with existing MongoDB models?
   - **Status**: Pending decision
   - **Impact**: Affects how we design data access in services
   - **Options**:
     - Reuse existing models
     - Create new abstractions
     - Hybrid approach

2. Should we introduce TypeScript gradually or maintain JavaScript?
   - **Status**: Pending decision
   - **Impact**: Affects development workflow and codebase consistency
   - **Options**:
     - Full JavaScript
     - JavaScript with JSDoc
     - Gradually introduce TypeScript
     - Full TypeScript conversion

3. How should we handle the transition period when both systems are active?
   - **Status**: Pending decision
   - **Impact**: Affects how quickly we can move to the new architecture
   - **Options**:
     - Feature flag approach
     - Service by service migration
     - Shadow mode (run both, verify results match)

## Technical Debt
*List any technical debt that needs to be addressed during Phase 1.*

## Risks
1. **Functionality Loss**: Core features might be missed during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough documentation of existing functionality before extraction
   - **Monitoring**: Compare behavior of old and new implementations

2. **Session State Incompatibility**: New session management might be incompatible with existing system
   - **Mitigation**: Design adapter pattern to bridge between systems
   - **Monitoring**: Track session-related errors during transition
