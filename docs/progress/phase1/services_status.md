# Phase 1: Core Services Status

> **Note**: Phase 1 is now complete with all core services implemented. Work has begun on Phase 2 (Platform-Agnostic Workflows). See progress tracking in the completed_tasks.md document.

## Overview
This document tracks the status of core services being extracted from the legacy codebase.

## Services

### 1. ComfyUI Service
**Status**: Implemented  
**Source Files**: `utils/bot/queue.js`, `commands/make.js`, workflows from MongoDB  
**Target File**: `src/core/services/comfyui.js`  
**Dependencies**: node-fetch  
**Description**: Handles interactions with ComfyUI API for image generation  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Provides clean interface for submitting generation requests
- Supports both ComfyDeploy API and direct ComfyUI API
- Implements proper authentication with API keys
- Includes workflow management and dynamic workflow selection
- Handles load balancing across multiple deployment IDs
- Tracks active requests with timeout handling
- Implements retry mechanism for API calls
- Processes and handles different types of generation outputs (images, gifs, videos)

### 2. Points Service
**Status**: Implemented  
**Source Files**: `utils/bot/points.js`  
**Target File**: `src/core/services/points.js`  
**Dependencies**: None (relies on injectable dependencies)  
**Description**: Manages user point balances, purchases, and transactions  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Provides methods for point deduction based on task type and duration
- Handles different accounting scenarios (API, cook mode, standard)
- Implements maximum balance calculation logic
- Supports group point accounting (partial implementation)
- Uses dependency injection for database and session access
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Supports different point types (points, qoints, doints, etc.)

### 3. Workflows Service
**Status**: Implemented  
**Source Files**: `utils/bot/intitialize.js`, workflow data in MongoDB  
**Target File**: `src/core/services/workflows.js`  
**Dependencies**: None (relies on injectable dependencies)  
**Description**: Manages loading and accessing available workflows  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Provides methods for loading workflow templates from the database
- Parses workflow JSON to extract required inputs
- Provides access to workflow configurations and deployment IDs
- Includes methods for checking workflow existence and validity
- Implements reloading workflows on demand
- Uses dependency injection for database models
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Media Service
**Status**: Implemented  
**Source Files**: `utils/bot/handlers/iMedia.js`, `utils/utils.js` (media functions), `utils/bot/bot.js` (getPhotoUrl)  
**Target File**: `src/core/services/media.js`  
**Dependencies**: node-fetch, jimp, fs  
**Description**: Handles media uploads, downloads, and transformations  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Provides platform-agnostic interface for media operations
- Implements file download from URLs and platform-specific sources
- Supports image processing with metadata extraction
- Includes persistent storage management for media files
- Uses dependency injection for platform-specific adapters
- Handles different media types (images, videos, documents, animations)
- Includes error handling and logging
- Supports various media transformation operations

### 5. Session Service
**Status**: Implemented  
**Source Files**: Global `lobby` object in `utils/bot/bot.js`, cleaning logic in `utils/bot/gatekeep.js`  
**Target File**: `src/core/services/session.js`  
**Dependencies**: None (relies on injectable dependencies)  
**Description**: Manages user sessions and preferences  
**Implementation Notes**:
- Provides platform-agnostic interface for session management
- Replaces the global lobby object from the original codebase
- Implements automatic session cleaning based on inactivity
- Supports persistence to database for session data
- Uses dependency injection for database and analytics
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- Provides methods for getting and setting session values
- Maintains backward compatibility with original lobby structure

## Migration Notes
- Services should follow consistent patterns for error handling and logging
- Each service should be testable in isolation
- Avoid introducing new dependencies during the extraction phase
- Phase 1 is now complete with all core services implemented
- Next phase will focus on integrating services and building the workflow layer
