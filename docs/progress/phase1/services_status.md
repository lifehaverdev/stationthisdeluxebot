## ComfyUI Service

The ComfyUI service has been fully refactored to use the ComfyUI Deploy API as its exclusive data source. Key improvements include:

- Comprehensive API endpoint coverage (runs, deployments, machines, workflow versions)
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Smart request batching to minimize API calls
- Support for file uploads and workflow management
- Proper type definitions and JSDoc documentation

### Implemented Functionality

- âœ… Workflow execution via `/api/run`
- âœ… Status checking via `/api/run?run_id=...`
- âœ… Result retrieval with image extraction
- âœ… Deployment management
- âœ… File uploading
- âœ… Workflow definition management
- âœ… Machine listing and selection
- âœ… Cancel run operation (new addition)

## Workflows Service

The Workflows service has been completely refactored to eliminate database dependencies and use the ComfyUI Deploy API as the source of truth:

- Direct API integration with ComfyUI Deploy for all workflow operations
- Time-based caching with configurable TTL for performance optimization
- Comprehensive workflow metadata extraction
- Proper indexing for fast lookups by name and ID

### Implemented Functionality

- âœ… Workflow listing via `/deployment`
- âœ… Workflow metadata extraction
- âœ… Deployment management
- âœ… Machine integration
- âœ… Workflow version handling
- âœ… Smart caching with configurable TTL
- âœ… Deployment lookup by ID
- âœ… Workflow lookup by name

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the refactored services with the platform adapters
2. Complete the refactoring of remaining core services
3. Implement monitoring for API performance
4. Update documentation for API usage patterns
5. Add comprehensive testing
