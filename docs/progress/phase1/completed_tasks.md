## Detailed Task Descriptions

### ComfyUI Deploy API Integration (2023-12-15)

Completed a major refactoring of the ComfyUI and Workflows services to use ComfyUI Deploy API as the primary and authoritative source of truth. This eliminates database dependencies for workflow information and streamlines the architecture:

- Enhanced ComfyUI service with comprehensive API endpoint coverage
- Refactored Workflows service to retrieve all workflow data directly from the API
- Implemented intelligent caching with configurable TTL for performance
- Added proper documentation with JSDoc
- Created ADR-003 documenting the architectural decision
- Created handoff document detailing current state and next steps

Key improvements:
- Eliminated data duplication and synchronization issues
- Simplified the architecture by removing database dependencies for workflows
- Ensured real-time data accuracy by always using the latest information from ComfyUI Deploy
- Added robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Improved maintainability and reduced technical debt

## Phase 0: Preparation & Analysis
- [x] Moved original src/ to archive/src/ for reference
- [x] Created new simplified directory structure
- [x] Conducted review of archived codebase
- [x] Created inventory of reusable components
- [x] Documented lessons learned and recommendations

## Planning & Setup
- [x] Created REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md with simplified architecture
