## Blockers

No significant blockers identified at this time.

## Notes

The Discord adapter implementation is following the clean separation pattern outlined in the REFACTOR_GENIUS_PLAN.md document. All platform-specific code is isolated in the adapter, with workflows and services remaining platform-agnostic.

The implementation offers feature parity with the Telegram adapter while leveraging Discord-specific capabilities such as slash commands, interactive components, and rich embeds.
